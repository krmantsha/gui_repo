# Unpacked streams can be downsampled by Seedlink. This is a list of strings
# where each item defines one unpack mapping in the format
# "SRC_LOCCHA:DST_ID:1" where DST_ID can be an arbitrary channel id which must
# match the definition of a stream in streams.xml. The last ":1" is optional
# and defines if the unpacked data should be doubled (duplicate each sample).
# In case rename mappings are active, SRC_LOCCHA referes to the final channel
# name after renaming.
