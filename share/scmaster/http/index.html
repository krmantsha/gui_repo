					<h2>It works!</h2>
					<p>
					This is the default page. If you see it in your browser then it most
					likely means that you have installed SeisComP successfully and that
					scmaster is running. Congratulations!
					</p>
					<p>
					This default page is located in your installation directory at
					<code>share/scmaster/http/index.html</code>. You are supposed to replace
					that page with a version that represents your organization or that
					describes the purpose of this installation.
					</p>
					<p>
					Replacing this page will not affect the functionality of the
					messaging system at all. Don't worry if you break things in your
					http root directory. And you don't need to restart scmaster
					if you have changed any files. Just reload the browser.
					</p>
					<h2>Replacing this page</h2>
					<div class="important message">
						<div class="content">
						Do not modify the default file as it will be overwritten when you
						update your installation!
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
					To avoid losing your changes after an update, create a new directory
					where you would like to save all of your files to be served.
					Re-configure scmaster to use that directory as http root directory.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Create new local http directory</li>
						<li>Set <code>http.filebase = /path/to/http/root</code> in <code>scmaster.cfg</code>
					</ol>
					<p>
					You can place any files you want into the http root path. scmaster
					will serve them happily. Add html files, stylesheets, images
					and any other kind of assets your page requires.
