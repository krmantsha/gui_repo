## 4.5.0

```SC_API_VERSION 14.2.0```

* magnitudes

  * mb and mB: add configurable distance ranges in global bindings
  * ML, MLv, MLh, md, MLr, Ms_20: unify the configuration in the magnitudes and amplitudes
    sections of global bindings. The number of magnitude types has grown over time
    and each magnitude had its own flavor of configuration. This made configurations
    increasingly difficult. By this change the configuration becomes homogeneous and easier.
    The corresponding parameters are deprecated and must be replaced by new ones either
    pre-pending "magnitudes." or "amplitudes." to the respective parameter.
    Warnings will be written to module logs if deprecated values are found. 
  * deprecated bindings parameter values : new values:

    * MLh.maxavg : amplitudes.MLh.params

## 4.1.0

```SC_API_VERSION 14.1.0```

* scmaster

  * Add IMPORT_GROUP to default group set

* screloc

  * Add option to allow processing of origins with mode MANUAL in daemon mode
  * When using --ep playbacks with origins defined by -O, then the processing
    is limited to the defined origins.

  * Update event agencyID and author on event update if it has
    changed. This is important if scevent has been reconfigured
    with a different agencyID or author.

    channels in FDSNWS dataselect POST format

* gui

  * Add option to define symbol images for layer points defined in
    either BNA or FEP

* seedlink

  * Fix parsing of global `backfill_buffer` variable. Up to this
    fix the variable was always considered out of bounds and apart from using
    backfill buffer settings in the bindings the global value had no effect.

* scolv

  * Fixed several segmentation faults in combination with offline
    mode
  * Add origin location method column to event origin table
  * Add shortcuts (ctrl+pgdown, ctrl+pgup) to select the previous and
    next event of the event list from within the locator view

* gui

  * Quit application if an error occurred during initialization
    and if the setup dialog is cancelled or closed by hitting

## 4.0.3

* slmod

  * Fix Python2 support

* scolv

  * Add origin depth type to event list and origins list

* base

    Armbruster for providing the patch.


## 4.0.0

```SC_API_VERSION 14.0.0```

This is the initial release of SeisComP under a new license and with a new
versioning scheme. Instead of using a release name and a time based version
tag semantic versioning is now being used with a sequence of three digits:
Major.Minor.Patch. The following rules apply for assigning a new digit:

* Major: Libraries introduce binary incompatible changes or there are very
  significant application changes which justify a major version bump.
* Minor: Libraries add new functionality and methods but binary
  compatibility within the same major release is still maintained
  with application built against a lower minor version. Significant
  application changes can also justify a minor version bump.
* Patch: No changes in functionality but error corrections of existing
  codes.

Breaking changes:

* Spread has been replaced as messaging system with our own implementation
  of a messaging broker. That means that connections between SeisComP3 and
  SeisComP >= 4.0.0 are not possible until a driver has been developed
  which implements Spread in SeisComP or scmp in SeisComP3.
* Qt5 and Python3 are now supported preferred.
* The SeisComP Python packages have been renamed to `seiscomp` but a
  compatibility layer for `seiscomp3` has been added.
* Arclink is no longer supported and has been removed completely.
* arclinkproxy has been removed as well and is superseded by scwfas.
* The installation directory is now `seiscomp` and not `seiscomp3`.
* The user configuration directory is now `.seiscomp` and not `.seiscomp3`.
* C++ compilation requires a compiler that supports at least the C++11
  standard.
