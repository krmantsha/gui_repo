Hypo71
######

The traditional Hypo71PC locator with SeisComP.

Description
===========

The Hypo71 locator algorithm by Fred Klein locator (:cite:t:`lee-1975`) has
been implemented into |scname| through the plugin mechanism. The plugin *hypo71*
contains the LocatorInterface implementation for Hypo71.
This plugin uses a slightly modified Hypo71 version from Alexandre Nercessian (IPGP)
which allows negative earthquake depth (above sea level) and negative stations
altitude (below sea level - OBS).

The development of this plugin was co-financed by the European Union and
`le Ministère de l'Ecologie, du Développement Durable, des Transports et du Logement
<http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr>`_
and developed by :cite:t:`ovsm` / :cite:t:`ipgp`.


How it works
============

When receiving a list of arrivals to locate, the plugin builds a Hypo71 input
file with informations from the station inventory and configured profile.
It then runs Hypo71, reads the output file and sends the results (location,
uncertainties, RMS, pick residuals ...) to |scname|.

If several trial depths are configured, the plugin will run as many Hypo71
rushes as configured depths.
Then all the results are read, and a decision is made on the best one, based on
location RMS and uncertainty.
A final run is then made with the best result depth as trial depth.


Profiles
========

The plugin allows the user to set up as many profiles as needed.
A profile contains all the information relative to the velocity model and
Hypo71 iteration parameters.

This allows the user to tune the behaviour of Hypo71 to what he needs.
If no profiles are set-up, the plugin will use default Hypo71 profile, according
to example shown in Hypo71 first publication.
Some of this default Hypo71 parameters have been altered to allow more and finer
iteration, since computer power is now far above what was available in the 1970's.


Error measures
==============

After running Hypo71, the output is converted into a |scname| origin (:term:`SCML`)
object including some error measures. The following table shows how
the Hypo71 error measures are mapped to the |scname| data model:

Plugin
======

The *hypo71* plugin is installed under :file:`share/plugins/hypo71.so`.
It provides a new implementation of the LocatorInterface with the name Hypo71.

To add the plugin to a module add it to the modules configuration, either
:file:`modulename.cfg` or :file:`global.cfg`:

.. code-block:: sh

   plugins = ${plugins}, hypo71

Basically it can be used by two |scname| modules: :ref:`screloc` and :ref:`scolv`.


Output
======

All output is stored in the configured :confval:`HYPO71ROOT`.

The following file are stored:

- Input file (input)
- Input configuration (.INP)
- Hypo71 location header (.OUT)
- Hypo71 location results (.PRT)
- Hypo71 ZTR evalutation log (.LOG)

In addition to the native Hypo71 outp ut a |scname| origin object is created and
returned to the calling instance. Usually this object is then sent via messaging.

In addition, the stdout output of the locator is redirected to |scname| output at
INFO level. Each line is identified by leading "Hypo71PC:", e.g.: ::

   12:02:25 [info] Hypo71PC:  Date   Heure Minute Seconde
   12:02:25 [info] Hypo71PC:  90113    22    48     3.78                                Nb Iterations :  3

To view this output on the command line add *--debug* to your application when executing on
the command line. Increasing logging level of the module which executes the plugin
allows to read the output in the log file: ::

   loggging.level = 3


Configuration example
=====================

To add the plugin to an application such as scolv or screloc, add the plugin
name to the list of plugins that are loaded (e.g. :file:`scolv.cfg`):

.. code-block:: sh

   plugins = ${plugins}, hypo71

Futhermore add the plugin configuration (e.g. :file:`scolv.cfg`):

.. code-block:: sh

.. code-block:: sh

   HYPO71.INP
   HYPO71.PRT

.. important ::

   There must be 3 blank lines at the end of the :file:`input` file, those are not to be removed.

Usage
=====

Locator
-------

The usage of the new Hypo71 plugin is straight forward. Once loaded successfully
the new locator shows up in the lower left corners combo box.

.. figure:: media/hypo71/locator_selection_small.png
   :align: center

Select the new Hypo71 locator and a profile from the pre-configured list.

.. figure:: media/hypo71/locator_profile_selection_small.png
   :align: center

The Hypo71 implementation doesn't provide a virtual profile automatically but the
plugins ships with some example profiles.

If an origin has been relocated the method should be set to "Hypo71" and
the earth model contains the name of the profile used to perform this localization.

.. figure:: media/hypo71/origin_information.png
   :align: center


Settings
--------

The Hypo71 locator implementation supports to override configured settings or
control parameters for a session. Those changes are not persistent and lost if
the locator is changed to another one or the profile has been changed.

To open the settings dialog press the button right to the locator selection
combo box.

.. figure:: media/hypo71/locator_settings.png
   :align: center

Then the Hypo71 selected profile parameters show up.

   .. code-block:: sh

      hypo71.profiles = a,b
      hypo71.profile.a.value1 = ...
      hypo71.profile.b.value1 = ...
      # c is not active because it has not been added

   specified depth but with free depth evaluation. This option
   defines whether it should really fix the depth \(false\) or
   use this fixed depth only as starting point \(true\).
