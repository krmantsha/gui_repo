**MiniSEED real time playback and simulation**


Description
===========

msrtsimul simulates a real-time data acquisition by injecting miniSEED data from a
file into the seedlink buffer via the mseedfifo plugin for seedlink. It can be
used for simulating real-time conditions in playbacks for whole-system
demonstrations, user training, etc.

The data are played back as if they were recorded at current time. Therefore, creation
times and the actual data times including pick times, event times etc. will be **faked**.
:ref:`Historic playbacks <sec-msrtsimul-historic>` allow keeping the actual data times.

.. warning::

   For real-time playbacks, the data must be sorted by time. This requirement
   may be violated. Use :ref:`scmssort` to sort the data by time.


Non-default seedlink pipes
--------------------------

By default, msrtsimul writes the data into the mseedfifo pipe
*$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/run/seedlink/mseedfifo*.
If the data are to be written into the pipe of a :program:`seedlink` alias or
into any other pipe, the pipe name must be adjusted. Use the option

* ``--seedlink`` to replace *seedlink* by another name, e.g. a seedlink instance
  created as an alias, **seedlink-test**. This would write into
  *$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/run/seedlink-test/mseedfifo*.
* ``--stdout`` to write to standard output and then redirect to any other location.


.. _sec-msrtsimul-historic:

Historic playbacks
------------------

You may use msrtsimul with the ``-m historic`` option to maintain the time of the records,
thus the times of picks, amplitudes, origins, etc. but not the creation times.
Applying ``-m historic`` will feed the data into the seedlink buffer at the time
of the records. The time of the system is untouched. GUI, processing modules, logging,
etc. will run with current system time. The historic mode allows to process waveforms
with the stream inventory valid at the time when the data were recorded including
streams closed at current time.

.. warning ::

   When repeating historic playbacks, the waveforms are fed multiple times to the
   seedlink buffer and the resulting picks are also repeated with the same pick
   times. This may confuse the real-time system. Therefore, seedlink and other modules
   creating or processing picks should be
   stopped, the seedlink buffer should be cleared and the processing
   modules should be restarted to clear the buffers before starting the
   historic playbacks. Make sure :ref:`scautopick` is configured or started with
   the ``--playback`` option. Example: ::

      $ seiscomp stop
      $ rm -rf $SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/lib/seedlink/buffer
      $ seiscomp start
      $ msrtsimul ...


seedlink setup
--------------

For supporting msrtsimul activate the :confval:`msrtsimul` parameter in the
seedlink module configuration (:file:`seedlink.cfg`), update the configuration
and restart seedlink before running msrtsimul: ::

   $ seiscomp update-config seedlink
   $ seiscomp restart seedlink
   $ msrtsimul ...


Examples
--------

1. Playback miniSEED waveforms in real time with verbose output:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ msrtsimul -v miniSEED-file

#. Playback miniSEED waveforms in historic mode. This may require :ref:`scautopick`
   to be started with the option *playback*:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ msrtsimul -v -m historic miniSEED-file

#. Feed the data into the buffer of a specific seedlink instance, e.g. *seedlink-test*:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ msrtsimul -v --seedlink seedlink-test miniSEED-file

Command-Line Options
====================

.. program:: msrtsimul

:program:`msrtsimul [OPTION] miniSEED-file`


Options
-------

.. option:: -c, --stdout

   write on standard output. The output my be redirected to a
   specific mseedfifo path.

.. option:: -d, --delays

   add artificial delays

.. option:: -s, --speed float

   speed factor. 1 is normal speed.

.. option:: -j, --jump float

   non\-standard names are used. Replaces 'seedlink'
   in the standard mseedfifo path.
