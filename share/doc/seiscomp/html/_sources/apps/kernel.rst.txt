**SeisComP kernel.**


Description
===========

The kernel is the basic configuration for the :command:`seiscomp` tool.
It contains configuration parameters for all init scripts in :file:`etc/init`. Each init script can, but does not
need to, read the kernel parameters and configure itself accordingly. Kernel parameters are not mandatory but
should be taken as (serious) hints. If for example syslog is enabled in the kernel then all init scripts should
configure syslog as logging backend for the programs they start. But if a program does not support syslog it can
also be started without logging to syslog.

Module Configuration
====================


.. note::

   kernel is a :term:`standalone module` and does not inherit :ref:`global options <global-configuration>`.


| :file:`etc/defaults/kernel.cfg`
| :file:`etc/kernel.cfg`
| :file:`~/.seiscomp/kernel.cfg`



.. confval:: syslog

   Default: ``false``

   Type: *boolean*

   Sends all logging output to the syslog backend which logs
   usually to \/var\/log\/messages.


.. _kernel/messaging:


messaging extension
-------------------

SeisComP messaging component that enables communication of modules over the network.


.. confval:: messaging.enable

   Default: ``true``

   Type: *boolean*

   Enables\/disables local messaging \(scmaster\).
   The messaging component is an integral component
   of all modules \(except e.g. acquisition modules\).
   If you are not sure what to do, enable it.


.. confval:: messaging.bind

   Type: *string*

   Defines the messaging unencrypted bind address. If
   left empty then the configuration file \(see scmaster\)
   will be used instead. Use this to override the
   unencrypted bind address. The format is
   \"[ip:]port\".
