**Database clean-up of processing results.**


Description
===========

SeisComPs processing is continuously writing to the database. This causes
the database to grow and to occupy much space on the harddisc. scdbstrip taggles
this problem and removed processed objects from the database older than a
configurable time span.

This clean-up procedure is based on events. scdbstrip will remove all events
with an origin time older than specified. It will also remove all associated
objects such as picks, origins, arrivals, amplitudes and so on.

scdbstrip does not run as a daemon. To remove old objects continuously scdbstrip
should be added to the list of cronjobs running every e.g. 30 minutes. The more
often it runs the less objects it has to remove and the faster it will unlock
the database again.


Known issues
============

When running scdbstrip for the first time on a large database it can happen
that it aborts in case of MYSQL with the following error message:


   .. code-block:: sh

      [  3%] Delete origin references of old events...08:48:22 [error]
      execute("delete Object from Object, OriginReference, old_events where
      Object._oid=OriginReference._oid and
      OriginReference._parent_oid=old_events._oid") = 1206 (The total number
      of locks exceeds the lock table size)

      Exception: ERROR: command 'delete Object from Object, OriginReference,
      old_events where Object._oid=OriginReference._oid and
      OriginReference._parent_oid=old_events._oid' failed

That means your MYSQL server cannot hold enough data required for deletion.
There are two solutions to this:

1. Increase the memory pool used by MYSQL by changing the configuration to:

   .. code-block:: sh

      innodb_buffer_pool_size = 64M

   The size of the new buffer depends on the size of the database that should
   be cleaned up.


2. Run scdbstrip on smaller batches for the first time:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ scdbstrip -d seis:mypass@localhost/seiscomp --days 1000
      $ scdbstrip -d seis:mypass@localhost/seiscomp --days 900
      ...
      $ scdbstrip -d seis:mypass@localhost/seiscomp --days 100


Examples
========

#. Keep the events of the last 30 days

   .. code-block:: sh

      scdbstrip --days 30 -d mysql://sysop:sysop@localhost/seiscomp

.. confval:: database.cleanup.keep.days

   Type: *int*

   The number of days to preserve in the database. This
   value is just one part of the whole timespan. Hours
   and minutes are configured separately.
   Default is ``30``.

.. confval:: database.cleanup.keep.hours

   Type: *int*

   The number of hours to preserve in the database. This
   value is just one part of the whole timespan. Days
   and minutes are configured separately.
   Default is ``0``.

.. confval:: database.cleanup.keep.minutes

   Type: *int*

   The number of minutes to preserve in the database. This
   value is just one part of the whole timespan. Days
   and hours are configured separately.
   Default is ``0``.


Command-line
============

.. option:: --config-file arg

   Use alternative configuration file. When this option is used
   the loading of all stages is disabled. Only the given configuration
   file is parsed and used. To use another name for the configuration
   create a symbolic link of the application or copy it, eg scautopick \-> scautopick2.

   Increase verbosity level \(may be repeated, eg. \-vv\)

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Quiet mode: no logging output

.. option:: --component arg

   Limits the logging to a certain component. This option can be given more than once.

.. option:: -s, --syslog

   Use syslog logging back end. The output usually goes to \/var\/lib\/messages.

.. option:: -l, --lockfile arg

   Path to lock file.

.. option:: --console arg

   Send log output to stdout.

.. option:: --debug

   Debug mode: \-\-verbosity\=4 \-\-console\=1

.. option:: --log-file arg

   Use alternative log file.


Database
--------

.. option:: --db-driver-list

   List all supported database drivers.

.. option:: -d, --database arg

   The database connection string, format: service:\/\/user:pwd\@host\/database.
   \"service\" is the name of the database driver which can be
   queried with \"\-\-db\-driver\-list\".

.. option:: --config-module arg

   The configmodule to use.

.. option:: --inventory-db arg

   Load the inventory from the given database or file, format: [service:\/\/]location

.. option:: --db-disable

   Do not use the database at all


Settings
--------

.. option:: --days arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`database.cleanup.keep.days`.
   The number of days to keep. Hours and minutes are also
   used the compute the whole time span.

.. option:: --hours arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`database.cleanup.keep.hours`.
   The number of hours to keep. Days and minutes are also
   used the compute the whole time span.

.. option:: --minutes arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`database.cleanup.keep.minutes`.
   The number of minutes to keep. Days and hours are also
   used the compute the whole time span.

.. option:: --datetime arg

   Replaces the days:hours:minutes timespan definition by an
   arbtrary absolute timestamp in UTC. The format is
