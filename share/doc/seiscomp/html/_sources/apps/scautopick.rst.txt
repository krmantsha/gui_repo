**Makes picks on waveforms.**


Description
===========

scautopick applies threshold monitoring by searching for waveform anomalies in
form of changes in amplitudes. It is applied for detecting phase arrivals and
and for measuring related amplitudes.


Phase Detections
================

scautopick detects phase onsets for generating :term:`picks <pick>`. Initally
it searches for P picks on the waveform streams defined by global bindings.

By default scautopick applies a robust STA/LTA detector
(:ref:`STALTA filter <filter-grammar>`) to waveforms for detecting P phases. Other
detection filters can be choosen from the :ref:`list of SeisComP filters <filter-grammar>`.
The waveforms are typically :ref:`pre-filtered<filter-grammar>`.
Without further configuration a running-mean highpass, a cosine taper and a Butterworth
bandpass filter of third order with corner frequencies of 0.7 and 2 Hz are applied before
the STALTA filter. The entire filter sequence is configurable by :confval:`filter`,
module configuration, or :confval:`detecFilter`, binding configuration.
Once the STA/LTA ratio has reached a configurable threshold (by default 3) for a
particular stream, a :term:`pick` is set to the time when this
threshold is exceeded (pick time) and the picker is set inactive. The picker is reactivated
for this stream once the STA/LTA ratio falls to the value of 1.5 (default).

The trigger thresholds are configurable:

* Trigger on: :confval:`thresholds.triggerOn` in module configuration or
  :confval:`trigOn` in binding configuration,
* Trigger off: :confval:`thresholds.triggerOff`, module configuration or :confval:`trigOff`,
  binding configuration.

Following inital P-phase detections a second-stage P-phase picker (post picker) and
a S-phase picker (secondary picker) can be applied. Configure :confval:`picker`,
:confval:`spicker` and global bindings parameters accordingly.

.. csv-table:: Second-stage pickers available by configuration of :confval:`picker` or :confval:`spicker`

   "AIC", "x", "", "picker.AIC"
   "BK", "x", "", "picker.BK"
   "S-L2", "", "x", "spicker.L2"

After having detected a P phase, scautopick will not accept any further P detection
until

* The amplitudes measured after filtering (:confval:`filter` in module configuration
  or :confval:`detecFilter` in binding configuration) fall below the
  :confval:`thresholds.triggerOff` (module configuration) or :confval:`trigOff`
  (binding configuration) and
* Amplitudes, :math:`A_{trigger}`, measured after filtering reach or
  exceed a threshold determined by :math:`T_{minOffset}` (:confval:`thresholds.minAmplOffset`),
  :math:`T_{dead}` (:confval:`thresholds.deadTime`) and the amplitude of the
  previous pick, :math:`A_{prev}`:

  .. math ::

     A_{trigger} \ge T_{minOffset} + A_{prev} * exp\left(-(dt/T_{dead})^2\right)

  if :math:`T_{dead} > 0`. Otherwise:

  .. math ::

     A_{trigger} \ge T_{minOffset}

  Here, :math:`dt` is the time passed since the last pick.
  :math:`T_{minOffset}` (:confval:`thresholds.minAmplOffset`) is typically similar to
  the trigger threshold, :confval:`thresholds.triggerOn` (module configuration) or
  :confval:`trigOn` (binding configuration).


Amplitude Measurements
======================

The second task of scautopick is to calculate amplitudes of a given type for the
corresponding magnitude type (see :ref:`scamp` for a list of amplitude types and
:ref:`scmag` for the magnitude types). Such amplitudes are required by:

* :ref:`scautoloc` for associating phase picks and generating a source location
* EEW (earthquake early warning) systems in order to provide raüid amplitudes for
  magnitudes as soon as source locations are available.

The time window for measuring amplitudes starts at the pick time. The window
length is constant and specific to the amplitude type. It can be adjusted in
global bindings. For example mb is calculated
for a fixed time window of 30 s after the pick, mB for time window of 60s, for
MLv a time window of 150 s is estimated to make sure that S-arrivals are inside
this time window. The pre-calculated amplitudes are sent out and received by
the magnitude tool, :ref:`scmag`.
The fixed time window poses a limitation to EEW system. Howver, a speed-up is
available with :confval:`amplitudes.enableUpdate`.
Read the :ref:`scamp` documentation for more details on amplitude measurements.


Modes of Operation
==================

scautopick usually runs in the background connected to a real-time data source
such as :ref:`Seedlink <seedlink>`. This is referred to as online mode. Another
option to run scautopick is on offline mode with files.


Real-time
---------

In real-time mode the workflow draws like this:

* scautopick reads all of its binding parameters and subscribes to stations
  defined by global binding parameters where :confval:`detecEnable` is set to ``true``.
* The data time window requested from the data source is [system-:confval:`leadTime`, NULL]
  meaning an open end time that causes :ref:`SeedLink <seedlink>` to stream
  real-time data if no more data are in the buffers.
* Each incoming record is filtered according to :confval:`detecFilter`.
* The samples are checked for exceedance of :confval:`trigOn` and in the positive
  case either a post picker (:confval:`picker`) is launched or a :term:`Pick <pick>`
  object will be sent.
* If :confval:`sendDetections` is set to ``true`` trigger will be sent in any
  case for e.g. debugging.
* After the primary stage has finished (detector only or picker) secondary
  pickers will be launched if configured with :confval:`spicker`.

These steps repeat for any incoming record.

To run scautopick in the background as a daemon module enable and start it ::

$ seiscomp enable scautopick
$ seiscomp start scautopick

For executing on the command line simply call it with appropriate options, e.g. ::

   $ seiscomp exec scautopick -h


Non-real-time
-------------

.. note::

   Due to code changes in the file data source, the command line option **--playback**
   is essential for non-real-time operation. Otherwise a real-time time window
   is set and all records are most likely filtered out.

To tune scautopick or to do playbacks it is helpful to run scautopick not with
a real-time data source but on a defined data set, e.g. a multiplexed sorted miniSEED
volume. scautopick will apply the same workflow as in online mode but the
acquisition of data records has to change. If the input data (file) has been
read, scautopick will exit and furthermore it must not ask for a particular
time window, especially not for a real-time time window. To accomplish that
the command-line parameter ```--playback``` has to be used. Example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ scautopick --playback -I data.mseed

This call will process all records in :file:`data.mseed` for which bindings
exist and **send the results to the messaging**. If all data records are processed,
scautopick will exit. The processing steps are similar to the online mode.

Use the ```--ep``` for offline processing **without messaging**. The results are
printed in :term:`SCML` format. Example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ scautopick --playback -I data.mseed --ep -d [type]://[host]/[database] > picks.xml

scautopick inherits :ref:`global options<global-configuration>`.



.. confval:: filter

   Type: *string*

   Defines the default filter used for picking. Station specific configurations
   will override this value.


.. confval:: timeCorrection

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   Time correction applied for each pick made. Station specific
   values override this value.
   Default is ``-0.8``.

.. confval:: ringBufferSize

   Type: *int*

   Unit: *s*

   Defined the record ringbuffer size in seconds.
   Default is ``300``.

.. confval:: leadTime

   Type: *int*

   Unit: *s*

   The leadTime defines the time in seconds to start picking on
   waveforms before current time.
   Default is ``60``.

.. confval:: initTime

   Type: *int*

   Unit: *s*

   The initTime defines a time span in seconds for that the picker
   is blind after initialization. This time is needed to initialize
   the filter and depends on it.
   Default is ``60``.

.. confval:: gapInterpolation

   Type: *boolean*

   Interpolate gaps linearly? This is valid for gaps shorter
   than thresholds.maxGapLength.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: amplitudes

   Type: *list:string*

   Defines the amplitude types to be computed by the picker as well.
   Default is ``MLv, mb, mB``.

.. confval:: picker

   Type: *string*

   Configures the picker to use. By default only a simple detections
   are emitted as picks. To enable real picking on a time window around
   the detection, an algorithm \(plugin\) can be defined with this parameter.
   Currently available is: \"AIC\", \"BK\" or
   \"GFZ\". More options may be available by plugins.
   Configure related parameters in global bindings.


.. confval:: spicker

   Type: *string*

   Configures the secondary picker to use, e.g. for pick S\-phases.
   Currently available is: \"S\-L2\". More options may
   be available by plugins. Configure related parameters
   in global bindings.


.. confval:: useAllStreams

   Type: *boolean*

   If enabled the all streams are used for picking that are received by the picker.
   This option has only effect if a file is used as input which contains more data than
   the picker requests. If connected to a waveform server such as SeedLink the picker
   will only receive the data it subscribed to.
   Default is ``true``.

.. confval:: killPendingSPickers

   Type: *boolean*

   If enabled the all secondary pickers that were triggered by
   a previous pick will be terminated when a new detection or
   pick has been found. This aims to avoid the case where an
   S phase is wrongly picked as P but would also be picked as
   S by the secondary picker. But suppressing the S pick can
   lead to undesired results. It might be better in some
   situations to have two picks \(P and S\) instead only a wrong
   P.
   Default is ``true``.

.. confval:: sendDetections

   Type: *boolean*

   If enabled and \"picker\" is configured, then initial detections
   are sent as well. To distinguish between detections and picks
   the evaluation status of the pick is set to \"rejected\".
   This is meant to be a debug option which can be used to compare
   detections and picks by their evaluation status.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: extraPickComments

   Type: *boolean*

   If enabled and \"picker\" or \"spicker\" is
   configured, then extra comments
   will be added to the resulting pick.
   
   Supported comments:
   
   SNR: added if SNR >\= 0, comment id is \"SNR\"
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: playback

   Type: *boolean*

   If enabled, picks can be made on waveforms which are older than
   current time \- \"leadTime\". Current time is the time
   when the module was started. This allows to pick
   historic data in real\-time playbacks which are preserving the
   record times. See e.g. the \"msrtsimul\" module.
   This option deactivates \"leadTime\". Activate only for playbacks.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: thresholds.triggerOn

   Type: *double*

   For which value on the filtered waveforms is a pick
   detected. Station specific values override this value.
   Default is ``3``.

.. confval:: thresholds.triggerOff

   Type: *double*

   The value the filtered waveforms must reach to enable
   detection again. Between triggerOn and triggerOff the
   picker is blind and does not produce picks. Station
   specific values override this value.
   Default is ``1.5``.

.. confval:: thresholds.maxGapLength

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   The maximum gap length in seconds to handle.
   Gaps larger than this will cause the picker to be reset.
   Default is ``4.5``.

.. confval:: thresholds.amplMaxTimeWindow

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   The time window used to compute a maximum \(snr\) amplitude
   on the filtered waveforms.
   Default is ``10``.

.. confval:: thresholds.deadTime

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   The time used together with measured amplitude and
   `thresholds.minAmplOffset` for scaling the amplitude below which
   the picker is inactive after a P pick. Read the documentation\!
   Default is ``30``.

.. confval:: thresholds.minAmplOffset

   Type: *double*

   The amplitude used together with measured amplitude and
   `thresholds.deadTime` for scaling the amplitude below which
   the picker is inactive after a P pick. The value is typically
   similar to the trigger threshold. Read the documentation\!
   Default is ``3``.

.. confval:: amplitudes.enableUpdate

   Type: *list:string*

   Configure a list of magnitude types.
   Update and send amplitudes for these magnitudes as soon as data are
   available. Do not wait for complete time windows.
   Only magnitudes computed by scautopick as given by the amplitudes parameter are considered.
   This option is for rapid magnitude estimation and EEW.
   
   WARNING: This option increases the load on the system\!


.. confval:: connection.amplitudeGroup

   Type: *string*

   Group used to send amplitudes to.
   Default is ``AMPLITUDE``.

   message \(enabled with \-\-start\-stop\-msg for the master module\).

.. option:: --shutdown-master-module arg

   Sets the name of the master\-module used for auto\-shutdown. This
   is the application name of the module actually started. If symlinks
   are used then it is the name of the symlinked application.

.. option:: --shutdown-master-username arg

   Sets the name of the master\-username of the messaging used for
   auto\-shutdown. If \"shutdown\-master\-module\" is given as well this
   parameter is ignored.

Mode
----

.. option:: --offline

   Do not connect to a messaging server and do not use the database.

.. option:: --playback

   Switches to playback mode which does not request a particular time window from
   the input data source. This implies that all records are forwarded to scautopick
   if files are being used. Without this option scautopick sets the requested
   start time to NOW\-leadTime and therefore would not work anymore with
   older datasets in offline mode or when running playbacks.

.. option:: --ep

   Outputs an XML event parameters file containing all picks and amplitudes.
   This option implies offline.

.. option:: --amplitudes arg

   Enables or disables computation of amplitudes.

.. option:: --test

   Runs the picker as usual but does not send any messages. This can be useful to
   test the picker within a running system.

.. option:: --dump-config

   Dumps the current configuration and exits. Station configuration is only read if
   the picker connects to the messaging and the database. In offline mode it will
   only dump the application specific setting unless a station.conf file is provided.

.. option:: --dump-records

   This option only works in combination with :option:`\-\-offline`. It will dump
   the data of an amplitude processor if it completed processing successfully
   and a new amplitude is available. The output format is a simple ASCII format.
