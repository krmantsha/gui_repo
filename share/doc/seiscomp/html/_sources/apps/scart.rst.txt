**Import/export MiniSEED data to/from SDS archives.**


Description
===========

The archive tool scart creates playback files (multiplexed miniSEED files) from
:term:`SDS` structured data (e.g. created by slarchive) or from data passed from
another record source such as :ref:`Arclink <rs-arclink>`. It can also playback
records directly out of an SDS structure. Furthermore it can be used to import
multiplexed miniSEED files into a local SDS structure.
So it is possible to save event based waveform data in combination with
scevtstreams into another archive.


.. _scart-config:

Configuration
=============

scart can make use of :ref:`global_recordstream`
implementations which are provided by additional plugins.
For loading additional plugins, e.g. the *xyz* plugin create and configure :file:`scart.cfg`:

.. code-block:: sh

   plugins = xyz


Examples
========

#. Extract data from the default :term:`SDS` archive in :file:`$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/lib/archive`
   or from a local :term:`SDS` archive [SDS archive] into a miniSEED file :file:`file.mseed`
   and sort by end time of the records:

   .. code-block:: sh

      scart -dsvE -t '[start-time]~[end-time]' > file.mseed
	  scart -dsvE -t '[start-time]~[end-time]' [SDS archive] > [file.mseed]

   .. note::

      Sorting data is computational expensive but required for waveform playbacks.

#. Push miniSEED data from file :file:`file.mseed` into a local :term:`SDS` archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      scart  -I file://[file.mseed] [SDS archive]

#. Collect data from an FDSNWS server using the :ref:`global_recordstream`
   interface and write to a miniSEED file. The data streams and the time spans are
   defined in a list file using the option ``list``. The list can be generated e.g.
   by :ref:`scevtstreams`.

   .. code-block:: sh

      scart  -I fdsnws://[server]:80 --list list.file --stdout > file.mseed

.. note::

   Repeated pushing of miniSEED data into an archive will duplicate the data.



Command-line
============

.. program:: scart

:program:`scart [options] {archive-dir}`

The last option has to be the archive directory when dump mode is enabled.
When no archive directory is explicitly given,
\$SEISCOMP_ROOT\/var\/lib\/archive or the current directory
is used depending on whether \$SEISCOMP_ROOT has been set or not.
The default operation mode is import. That means that a multiplexed
MiniSEED file or another record source such as ArcLink is used to import
records into a SDS structure.


Verbosity
---------

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Verbose mode.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Display a help message.


Mode
----

.. option:: -d, --dump

   Set export \(dump\) mode. Records are retrieved from an archive and
   written to standard output.

.. option:: -I

   Import mode: Specify the recordstream URL when in import mode.
   When using another recordstream than a file \(like ArcLink\) a stream
   list file is required. Default: file:\/\/\- \(stdin\).


Output
------

.. option:: -t timewindow

   Specify the time window \(as one properly quoted string\) to dump
   records for. Times are UTC and separated by a tilde \"\~\".
   To dump one hour of waveform data between 2008\/01\/01 00:00:00 and
   2008\/01\/01 01:00:00 use
   <\-t \"2008\-01\-01 00:00:00\~2008\-01\-01 01:00:00\">.

.. option:: -l, --list file

   Uses a stream list file instead of defined networks and channels
   \(\-n and \-c are ignored\). The list can be generated from events
   by scevetstreams. Line format: starttime;endtime;streamID.
   The time format is the same as described in option '\-t'.
   
   Example:
   
   2019\-07\-17 02:00:00;2019\-07\-17 02:10:00;GR.CLL..BHZ

.. option:: -s, --sort

   Sort records by [start\-]time. To sort records by their endtime use \-E.

.. option:: -E

   Sort records according to their end time. Default: start time.

.. option:: -m, --modify

   Modify the record time for real time playback when in export mode.
   The first record time is NOW. The relative time of successive records
   to the first one are kept.

.. option:: --speed

   Specify the speed to dump the records. A value of 0 means no delay
   otherwise speed is a multiplier of the real time difference between
   the records. When feeding the records directly into the replay pipe
   a value of 1 \(real time\) is recommended.

.. option:: -n networks

   List of network codes to dump \(comma separated\). Default: \*.

.. option:: -c channels

   Specify the channel filter for the dumped streams as regular
   expression. Default: \(B\|S\|M\|H\)\(L\|H\)\(Z\|N\|E\). To dump only
   BHZ, BHN and BHE streams use BH\(Z\|N\|E\).

.. option:: --files count

   Specify the number of file handles to cache. Default: 100.

.. option:: --test

   Test mode, no record output. This switch is useful for debugging.
