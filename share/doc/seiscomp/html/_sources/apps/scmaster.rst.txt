**The messaging system**


Description
===========

scmaster is the implementation of the :ref:`messaging <concepts_messaging>`
mediator.


Message Groups
==============

scmaster provides the :ref:`message groups <messaging-groups>`. Configure

* :confval:`defaultGroups`: Add the groups which can be used by all queues.
* :confval:`queues.$name.groups`: Add all groups which are used by the given queue.
  Adding any values ignores all values of :confval:`defaultGroups`.


Queues
======

scmaster provides :ref:`queues <messaging-queues>` for separating the processing.
Typically, the default queue *production* is used. To add new queues

#. Define a new queue by adding a new profile with some name,
#. Configure the profile parameters :confval:`queues.$name.*,
#. Register the queue in :confval:`queues`.


Scheme
======

scmaster provides unsecured and secured connection which is addressed by the
scheme values *scmp* and *scmps*, respectively, in :confval:`connection.server`
when connecting to the messaging.
Read the :ref:`concepts section <messaging-scheme>` for more details. *scmps*
is in use when configuring :confval:`interface.ssl.bind`.


Database Access
===============

scmaster reads from and writes to the database and reports the database connection
to the clients of the messaging system (compare with the :ref:`concepts section <messaging-db>`).

The database is configured per queue.
When running all |scname| modules on a single machine, the read and write
parameters are typically configured with *localhost* as a *host name*.

Example: ::

   queues.production.processors.messages.dbstore.read = sysop:sysop@localhost/seiscomp
   queues.production.processors.messages.dbstore.write = sysop:sysop@localhost/seiscomp

However, if the clients are
located on machines different from the messaging, the *host name* of the read parameter
must be available on the client machine and the client machine must be able to
connect to the host with its name. If the database is on the same machine as the
messaging, the *host name* of the write connection typically remains *localhost*.

Example for connecting clients on computerB to the messaging on computerA (compare
with the :ref:`concepts section <messaging-distribution>`).

* Configuration of scmaster on computerA: ::

     queues.production.processors.messages.dbstore.read = sysop:sysop@computerA/seiscomp
     queues.production.processors.messages.dbstore.write = sysop:sysop@localhost/seiscomp

* Global configuration of client on computerB: ::

     connection.server = computerA/production

.. confval:: defaultGroups

   Type: *list:string*

   The default set of message groups for each queue. Only used
   if a queues group list is unset \(note: empty is not unset\).
   Default is ``AMPLITUDE, PICK, LOCATION, MAGNITUDE, FOCMECH, EVENT, QC, PUBLICATION, GUI, INVENTORY, CONFIG, LOGGING, SERVICE_REQUEST, SERVICE_PROVIDE, STATUS_GROUP``.

.. confval:: queues

   Type: *list:string*

   Enable messaging queues defined as profile in queues. The profile
   names are the final queue names.
   Default is ``production, playback``.

.. note::
   **interface.\***
   *Control the messaging interface. The default protocol is*
   *"scmp" but "scmps" (secure protocol) is*
   *used when valid SSL certificate and key are configured.*



.. confval:: interface.bind

   Type: *ipbind*

   Local bind address and port of the messaging system.
   0.0.0.0:18180 accepts connections from all clients, 127.0.0.1:18180
   only from localhost.
   Default is ``0.0.0.0:18180``.

.. confval:: interface.acl

   Type: *list:ipmask*

   The IP access control list for clients which are allowed
   to connect to the interface.


.. confval:: interface.socketPortReuse

   Type: *boolean*

   SO_REUSEADDR socket option for the TCP listening socket.
   Default is ``true``.

.. note::
   **interface.ssl.\***
   *SSL encryption is used if key and certificate are configured.*



.. confval:: interface.ssl.bind

   Type: *ipbind*

   Additional local bind address and port of the messaging system
   in case SSL encryption is active.
   Default is ``0.0.0.0:-1``.

.. confval:: interface.ssl.acl

   Type: *list:ipmask*

   The IP access control list for clients which are allowed
   to connect to the interface.


.. confval:: interface.ssl.socketPortReuse

   Type: *boolean*

   SO_REUSEADDR socket option for the TCP listening socket.
   Default is ``true``.

.. confval:: interface.ssl.key

   Type: *path*

   


.. confval:: interface.ssl.certificate

   Type: *path*

   


.. note::
   **queues.\***
   *Set the parameters for each messaging queue. The queues are used*
   *when listed in the "queues" parameter. Several queues*
   *can be used in parallel. For queues with without databases leave*
   *the processor parameters empty.*



.. note::

   **queues.$name.\***
   $name is a placeholder for the name to be used and needs to be added to :confval:`queues` to become active.

   .. code-block:: sh

      queues = a,b
      queues.a.value1 = ...
      queues.b.value1 = ...
      # c is not active because it has not been added
      # to the list of queues
      queues.c.value1 = ...


.. confval:: queues.$name.groups

   Type: *list:string*

   Define the list of message groups added to the queue. If unset
   then the defaultGroups will be used. A queue will always
   add the default group \"STATUS_GROUP\". This
   parameter overrides defaultGroups.


.. confval:: queues.$name.acl

   Type: *list:ipmask*

   The IP access control list for clients which are allowed
   to join the queue.
   Default is ``0.0.0.0/0``.

.. confval:: queues.$name.maximumPayloadSize

   Type: *int*

   Unit: *B*

   The maximum size in bytes of a message to be accepted.
   Clients which send larger messages will be disconnected.
   The default is 1MB.
   Default is ``1048576``.

.. confval:: queues.$name.plugins

   Type: *list:string*

   List of plugins required by this queue. This is just a
   convenience parameter to improve configurations
   readability. The plugins can also be added to the
   global list of module plugins.
   
   Example: dbstore


.. confval:: queues.$name.processors.messages

   Type: *string*

   Interface name. For now, use \"dbstore\" to
   use a database.
   
   Use empty for testing or playbacks without a database.


.. note::
   **queues.$name.processors.messages.dbstore.\***
   *Define the database connection parameters.*



.. confval:: queues.$name.processors.messages.dbstore.driver

   Type: *string*

   Selected the database driver to use. Database drivers are
   available through plugins. The default plugin is dbmysql
   which supports the MYSQL database server. It is activated
   with the core.plugins parameter.


.. confval:: queues.$name.processors.messages.dbstore.read

   Type: *string*

   Sets the database read connection which is reported to clients
   that connect to this server. If a remote setup should be
   implemented, ensure that the hostname is reachable from
   the remote computer.


.. confval:: queues.$name.processors.messages.dbstore.write

   Type: *string*

   Sets the database write connection which is private to
   scmaster. A separate write connection enables different
   permissions on the database level for scmaster and
   clients.


.. confval:: queues.$name.processors.messages.dbstore.strictVersionMatch

   Type: *boolean*

   If enabled, the plugin will check the database schema version and refuse to start
   if the version doesn't match the latest version. If disabled and the an object
   needs to be stored which is incompatible with the database schema this object is
   lost. Leave this option enabled unless you know exactly what are you doing and what
   the consequences are.
   Default is ``true``.

.. confval:: http.filebase

   Type: *path*

   The directory served by the http server at staticPath.
   Default is ``@DATADIR@/scmaster/http/``.

.. confval:: http.staticPath

   Type: *string*

   The URL path at which html files and assets are available.
   All files under filebase will be served at this URL path.
   Default is ``/``.

.. confval:: http.brokerPath

   Type: *string*

   The URL path at which the broker websocket is available.
   Default is ``/``.
