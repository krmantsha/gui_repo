<dt id="term-fault-plane-solution">fault-plane solution</dt><dd><p>Representation of the fault activated in an earthquake and the caused direction of slip on the fault by
a circle with two intersecting curves looking like a beach ball. A fault-plane solution is found by the
analysis of seismic records at many stations of an earthquake to obtain the radiation pattern. From the
radiation pattern the fault parameter and the slip direction are determined using a stereographic
projection or its mathematical equivalent. The most common analysis uses the direction of first motion
of P wave onsets and yields two possible orientations for the fault rupture and the direction of seismic
slip. Another technique is to use the polarization of teleseismic <a class="reference internal" href="#term-s-wave"><span class="xref std std-term">S waves</span></a> and/or to measure amplitude
ratios between different phase types. Further inferences can be made from these data concerning the
principal axes of stress in the region of the earthquake. The principal stress axes determined by this
method are the compressional axis (also called the P-axis, i.e. the axis of greatest compression, or s1),
the tensional axis (also known as the T-axis, i.e., the axis of least compression, or s3), and the
intermediate axis (s2).</p>

may be difficult to recognize.</p>

is uniformly applicable to all earthquake sizes but is more difficult to compute than the other types. In
principal, all magnitude scales could be cross calibrated to yield the same value for any given earthquake, but
this expectation has proven to be only approximately true, thus the magnitude type as well as its value

</div><p>with Δ being the distance of the station to the earthquake location. ML is a magnitude scale for
recordings of earthquakes smaller than ML 7 at regional stations. It is usually a measure of the
regional-distance S-wave on horizontal component records.
The original formula is only valid for records from a Wood-Anderson torsion seismometer with a natural period of
0.8 s and shallow earthquakes in California. Therefore calibration functions for other regions and wider
depth ranges are necessary. A Wood-Anderson seismometer has to be simulated. For amplitudes measurements
on the vertical component records additional correction factors has to be applied. ML saturates at
magnitudes around 7 because the maximum amplitudes of larger earthquakes occur at longer periods than
the bandpass of 0.1 s and 3 s for the magnitude calculation.</p>

whereas instrumental (internal) noise may be due to the flicker noise of electronic
components and/or even Brownian molecular motions in mechanical components. Digital
data acquisition systems may add digitization noise due to their finite discrete
resolution (least significant digit). Very sensitive seismic recordings may contain
all these different noise components, however, usually their resolution is tuned so
that only seismic signals and to a certain degree also the ambient noise are resolved.
Disturbing noise can be reduced by selecting recording sites remote from noise sources,

<dt id="term-wadati-benioff-zone">Wadati-Benioff zone</dt><dd><p>A dipping planar (flat) zone of earthquakes that is produced by the interaction
of a downgoing oceanic crustal plate with a continental plate. These earthquakes
can be produced by slip along the subduction thrust fault (thrust interface between
the continental and the oceanic plate) or by slip on faults within the downgoing
plate as a result of bending and extension as the plate is pulled into the mantle.
Slip may also initiate between adjacent segments of downgoing plates. Wadati-Benioff
zones are usually well-developed along the trenches of the Circum-Pacific belt,
dipping towards the continents.</p>

<dt id="term-wave-number">wave number</dt><dd><p>Number of cycles of a repeating signal per unit length, typically per meter of kilometer.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-p-wave">P wave</dt><dd><p>P (primary) waves are compressional waves involving volumetric variations in the
media. The sense of particle motion is linear and parallel to the propagation
direction. P waves are body waves that traverse the interior of a body/Earth and
can propagate in fluids.</p>
<p>The general nomenclature for P waves: At local and
regional distances a special nomenclature is used to describe the travel path of
the first P and S arrivals. Pg, Pb/P* and Pn phases are separated. Pg is the direct
P wave arriving first in distances less than around 100 km. Pn is the head wave
along the Moho arriving first at larger distances than 100 km (depending on the
crustal thickness). Pn has usually smaller amplitudes than Pg. Pb or P* is the
rarely observed head wave travelling along the midcrustal velocity discontinuity.
The general nomenclature of P waves entitles reflections at the topside of boundaries
with lowercase letters (m – Moho reflection; c - CMB reflection; i - inner core-outer
core boundary reflection), e.g. PmP is a reflected P wave at the Moho. Reflections
at the bottom side of boundaries get no additional letter, e.g. PP is a reflected
P wave at the Earth’s surface. Refracted rays get capital letters (K - through
the outer core; I - through the inner core), e.g. PKIKP is a P wave traversing
the crust/mantle, the outer core, the inner core, again the outer core and again
the mantle/crust.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-s-wave">S wave</dt><dd><p>S (secondary) waves are shear waves without any volumetric variation in the media.
The sense of particle motion is perpendicular to the propagation direction. S waves
are body waves that traverse the interior of a body but can not propagate in fluids.</p>
<p>Analog to the P arrivals Sg, Sb/S<sup>*</sup> and Sn arrivals are distinguished in local
and regional distances. The general nomenclature of S waves is analog to the P waves.
The reflections at the topside of boundaries have lowercase letters (m - Moho
reflection; c - CMB reflection), e.g. SmS is a reflected S wave at the Moho.
Reflections at the bottom side of boundaries get no additional letter, e.g. SS is a
reflected S wave at the Earth’s surface. Refracted rays get capital letters (J - through
the inner core), e.g. SKJKS is a S wave traversing the crust/mantle, the outer core
as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-p-wave"><span class="xref std std-term">P wave</span></a>, the inner core as a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-s-wave"><span class="xref std std-term">S wave</span></a>, again the outer core as a P wave and again
the mantle/crust as S wave. S waves can not travel through the outer core because
the outer core consists of a fluid.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-surface-wave">surface wave</dt><dd><p>Surface waves are seismic waves observed only at the free surface of the media.
Two types of surface waves are distinguished: <a class="reference internal" href="#term-love-wave"><span class="xref std std-term">Love waves</span></a> (L)
