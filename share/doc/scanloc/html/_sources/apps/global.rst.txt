   at all until signalBegin is reached. The data time window start
   is the minimum of noiseBegin and signalBegin.
   Default is ``0``.

.. confval:: picker.AIC.signalBegin

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   Overrides the default time \(relative to the trigger
   time\) of the begin of the signal window used to pick.
   Default is ``-30``.

.. confval:: picker.AIC.signalEnd

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   Overrides the default time \(relative to the trigger
   time\) of the begin of the signal window used to pick.

.. note::
   **spicker.L2.\***
   *L2 is an algorithm to pick S-phases based on existing P-phases. The*
   *picker interface name to be used in configuration files is*
   *"S-L2".*



.. confval:: spicker.L2.noiseBegin

   at all until signalBegin is reached. The data time window start
   is the minimum of noiseBegin and signalBegin.
   Default is ``-10``.

.. confval:: spicker.L2.signalBegin

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   Overrides the relative start time \(relative to the triggering
   pick\) of the begin of the signal processing.

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   The time correction \(in seconds\) added to the detection time
   before AIC time window is computed.
   Default is ``0``.

.. confval:: spicker.L2.marginAIC

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   The AIC time window around the detection used to pick. If 0 AIC is not used.
   Default is ``5``.

.. confval:: spicker.L2.minSNR

Command Line
============


Generic
-------

.. option:: -h, --help

   show help message.

.. option:: -V, --version

   show version information

.. option:: --config-file arg

   Use alternative configuration file. When this option is used
   the loading of all stages is disabled. Only the given configuration
   file is parsed and used. To use another name for the configuration
   create a symbolic link of the application or copy it, eg scautopick \-> scautopick2.

.. option:: --plugins arg

   Load given plugins.

.. option:: -D, --daemon

   Run as daemon. This means the application will fork itself and
   doesn't need to be started with \&.

.. option:: --auto-shutdown arg

   Enable\/disable self\-shutdown because a master module shutdown. This only
   works when messaging is enabled and the master module sends a shutdown
   message \(enabled with \-\-start\-stop\-msg for the master module\).

.. option:: --shutdown-master-module arg

   Sets the name of the master\-module used for auto\-shutdown. This
   is the application name of the module actually started. If symlinks
   are used then it is the name of the symlinked application.

.. option:: --shutdown-master-username arg

   Sets the name of the master\-username of the messaging used for
   auto\-shutdown. If \"shutdown\-master\-module\" is given as well this
   parameter is ignored.


Verbose
-------

.. option:: --verbosity arg

   Verbosity level [0..4]. 0:quiet, 1:error, 2:warning, 3:info, 4:debug

.. option:: -v, --v

   Increase verbosity level \(may be repeated, eg. \-vv\)

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Quiet mode: no logging output

.. option:: --print-component arg

   For each log entry print the component right after the
   log level. By default the component output is enabled
   for file output but disabled for console output.

.. option:: --print-context arg

   For each log entry print the source file name and line
   number.

.. option:: --component arg

   Limits the logging to a certain component. This option can be given more than once.

.. option:: -s, --syslog

   Use syslog logging back end. The output usually goes to \/var\/lib\/messages.

.. option:: -l, --lockfile arg

   Path to lock file.

.. option:: --console arg

   Send log output to stdout.

.. option:: --debug

   Debug mode: \-\-verbosity\=4 \-\-console\=1

.. option:: --trace

   Trace mode: \-\-verbosity\=4 \-\-console\=1 \-\-print\-component\=1 \-\-print\-context\=1

.. option:: --log-file arg

   Use alternative log file.


Messaging
---------

.. option:: -u, --user arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`connection.username`.

.. option:: -H, --host arg

.. option:: -t, --timeout arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`connection.timeout`.

.. option:: -g, --primary-group arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`connection.primaryGroup`.

.. option:: -S, --subscribe-group arg

   A group to subscribe to. This option can be given more than once.

.. option:: --content-type arg

   Overrides configuration parameter :confval:`connection.contentType`.

.. option:: --start-stop-msg arg

   Sets sending of a start\- and a stop message.


Database
--------

.. option:: --db-driver-list

   List all supported database drivers.

.. option:: -d, --database arg

   The database connection string, format: service:\/\/user:pwd\@host\/database.
   \"service\" is the name of the database driver which can be
   queried with \"\-\-db\-driver\-list\".

.. option:: --config-module arg

   The configmodule to use.

.. option:: --inventory-db arg

   Load the inventory from the given database or file, format: [service:\/\/]location

.. option:: --config-db arg

   Load the configuration from the given database or file, format: [service:\/\/]location


Records
-------

.. option:: --record-driver-list

   List all supported record stream drivers

.. option:: -I, --record-url arg

   The recordstream source URL, format: [service:\/\/]location[#type].
   \"service\" is the name of the recordstream driver which can be
   queried with \"\-\-record\-driver\-list\". If \"service\"
   is not given \"file:\/\/\" is used.

.. option:: --record-file arg

   Specify a file as record source.

.. option:: --record-type arg

   Specify a type for the records being read.


Cities
------

.. option:: --city-xml arg

   The path to the city.xml file. This overrides the default paths.


User interface
--------------

.. option:: -F, --full-screen
