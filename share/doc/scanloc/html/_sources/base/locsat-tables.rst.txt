Dense Travel-Time Tables
========================

The default travel time tables of SeisComP for :cite:t:`locsat` provide the
times in intervals of 1 degree epicentral distance. Thus, the curvature of the
travel-time curve at closer distance is not well imaged potentially resulting in
wrong locations or missing event solutions. Therefore, the LOCSAT tables,
*iasp91_scanloc*, based on the IASP91 model with higher spacial sampling are
added. The tables are located in :file:`$SEISCOMP_ROOT/share/locsat/tables`.

   Differences between P-wave travel times in the standard iasp91 tables for LOCSAT
   and the iasp91_scanloc tables provided with scanloc for an event at 5 km depth.


Configuration
-------------

Configure :confval:`association.table` and :confval:`locator.profile` with
*iasp91_scanloc* for making use of the provided LOCSAT tables.

.. code-block:: params

   # Type of travel-time tables for phase association. May be different from locator.
   # Use e.g. libtau or LOCSAT.
   association.tableType = LOCSAT

   # Name of travel-time table used for phase association. May be different from locator
   # profile.
   association.table = iasp91_scanloc

   # The locator type to use
   locator.type = LOCSAT

   # The locator profile to use
   locator.profile = iasp91_scanloc
