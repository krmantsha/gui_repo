Auxiliary Scripts
=================

The scanloc package also ships with auxiliary scripts for real-time or non-real-time
playbacks and tuning. For these tools, the usual options (``-h``, ``--debug``, etc.)
apply. Read the :ref:`scanloc-example` section for example applications.


.. _sec-scanloc-dump_picks:

dump_picks
----------

:program:`dump_picks` reads picks and amplitudes from a database and writes them
to file or the commandline in XML format (:term:`SCML`). Control the database
request to filter by

* Author (``--author``) contributing the object,
* Comparison with inventory (``--check-inventory``),
* Object evaluation mode (``--mode``),
* Object evaluation status (``--manual``, ``--automatic``),
* Region of contributing station (``--region``),
* Time (``--time-window``, ``--hours``, ``--start``).

**Examples:**

.. code-block:: sh

   dump_picks -h
   dump_picks -t "2022-01-20 13:52:00~2022-01-20 13:57:00" -d localhost --author l1autopick

.. note::

   Multiple :term:`SCML` files can be merged into one using :cite:t:`scxmlmerge`.


.. _sec-scanloc-playback_picks:

playback_picks
--------------

:program:`playback_picks` plays back picks with amplitudes from XML files at
normal or different speed and send them to the messaging system.
:program:`playback_picks` supports multiple pipelines. The script allows
controlling:

* Message groups: Append the message groups for sending picks and amplitudes.
* Mode (``--mode``): In real-time mode a constant number of seconds is added
  to pick, creation and amplitude reference times when sending to the messaging
  for mimicking real-time placks at current time. The seconds to add is derived
  from the time of the first option. Default mode is *historic*.
* Speed (``--speed``): Set a speed factor.
* Start (``--jump``): Ignore the first objects within the given number of
  seconds.
* Timing (``--timing``): Define the sorting of the objects. Default is
  *creationTime*. Consider the comments on timing in section
  :ref:`scanloc-example`.

**Examples:**

.. code-block:: sh

   playback_picks -h
   playback_picks picks.xml:PICK:AMPLITUDE l1picks.xml:L1PICK:AMPLITUDE --timing pickTime
