Introduction
============

scanloc is optimzed for monitoring local and micro seismicity within small as
well as large seismic networks in low and high seismicity environments.
Typical networks consist of 5 to 20 stations
and sometimes even many more were the station distances are in the range of
hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers.

scanloc makes use of the cluster search algorithm DBSCAN :cite:p:`dbscan` to
associate detected phase to one or many potential earthquake sources. While the
cluster search itself is based on P phases only, in a second step S and more P
phases are also associated and used for locating the seismic event.

In order to provide high-quality picks from S phases, a new S picker is distributed
along with scanloc. The S picker allows to identify S phases on the horizontal
components or on the vertical components if the horizontals should be unavailable.
A user-friendly GUI allows to tune the S picker configuration.

Additonal Python modules delivered with scanloc support detailed tuning and
realistic playbacks.


Examples from science
---------------------

scanloc has been routinely applied, demonstrated, promoted and discussed with
scientists and the SeisComP community in scientific publications and at
international science conferences.
