Advanced S-Phase Detector
=========================

The :ref:`scanloc` package provides the enhanced S-phase detectors,
S-AIC and S-AIC-V, as well as the :ref:`debugger<scanloc-spick-debugger>`.


Overview
--------

The *scanloc* package includes two S phase pickers: S-AIC and S-AIC-V, enhancing the
performance of the picker with respect to the OpenSource S-L2. Both picker
apply an AIC algorithm in order to detect S phases after a P pick was maked.
Therefore S phases are only detected after a P detection.
Using the S-AIC, S picks are determined on the vectorial sum of the horizontal
componentes (L2 trace).
The S-AIC-V works like the S-AIC but it picks S phases on the vertical component.

The performance of the pickers have been tested by comparison of automatic
with manual picks (see the :ref:`Figure showing the comparison<scanloc-fig-picker-comparison>`).

   Performance comparison showing the differences in pick time from manual picks
   and the optimally tuned pickers S-L2, S-AIC and S-AIC-V for local earthquakes
   in West-Bohemia/Vogtland. The area is typical of local earthquake monitored at
   short epicentral distances of a few tens of kilometers. The distribution of
   the differences in the automatic pick times with respect to the manual ones
   shows the increased performance using the S-AIC.


Configuration
-------------

1. Add the plugin *saic* to the configuration of :program:`scautopick` or the global
   module configuration for making use of the S-AIC or the S-AIC-V:

   .. code-block:: sh

      plugins = ${plugins},saic

#. Activate one of the S-phase ickers (S-L2, S-AIC, S-AIC-V) by changing the name
   of the S picker in the module
   configuration of :program:`scautopick`. Deactivating *killPendingSPickers* will allow
   to pick S phases even if more P phases were detected before:

   .. code-block:: sh

      spicker = "S-AIC"
      killPendingSPickers = false

#. Configure the S-picker parameters under *spicker* in global section of the
   bindings of :program:`scautopick`. E.g. for
   *S-AIC* in local earthquake monitoring (all values must be adjusted to the
   actual data):

   .. code-block:: sh

      detecFilter = "RMHP(10)>>ITAPER(30)>>BW(4,4,20)>>STALTA(0.2,20)"
      timeCorr = 0

      spicker.AIC.noiseBegin = -10
      spicker.AIC.signalBegin = 0.5
      spicker.AIC.filter = "ITAPER(4)>>BW_HP(4,3)"
      spicker.AIC.detecFilter = ""
      spicker.AIC.step = 0.5
      spicker.AIC.minSNR = 5
      spicker.AIC.minCnt = 5

   The AIC parameters *spicker.AIC.* are used for *S-AIC* and for *S-AIC-V*.
   The parameters of the S-phase pickers can be configured in the global section of the
   bindings profile of :program:`scautopick`. The meaning of some parameters are shared
   between the S-phase pickers:

      for effects due to the data processing, filtering and to compute the SNR."
      ":confval:`signalBegin`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V, S-L2","Start of the data processing relative to the reference P pick."
      ":confval:`signalEnd`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V, S-L2","End of the data processing relative to the reference P pick."
      ":confval:`filter`","S-AIC, S-L2","Filter applied before forming the L2 trace."
      ":confval:`detectFilter`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V, S-L2","Filter applied on the L2 trace before AIC analysis."
      ":confval:`step`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V","Step size in which the time windows are enlarged."
      ":confval:`minSNR`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V, S-L2","Minimum SNR in order to accept a pick."
      ":confval:`minCnt`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V","Minimum number the AIC minimum must be found for subsequent time windows."
      ":confval:`uncertainty`","S-AIC, S-AIC-V","Pick uncertainty. Unused by the picker but part of the output pick element."

S-Picker Debugger
-----------------

The :ref:`debugger GUI<scanloc-fig-debugger>` allows the graphics-assisted tuning of the S pickers, S-L2,
S-AIC, S-AIC-V. In order to make use of the S picker debugging GUI

#. Add the plugin *spickdbg* to the configuration of :program:`scolv`.
#. Configure the initial parameters in the global bindings of the considered stream.

The debugger GUI can be started from the picker window of :program:`scolv`.
If there is an existing P pick the debugger window can be opened with a
right click on the P pick. In the dropdown menu the S picker type can be chosen.
A new pop-up window opens where the P pick (red line) and the newly determined S
pick (light blue line) are shown and the parameters can be tested.

The :ref:`example below <scanloc-fig-debugger>` shows the debugger GUI for a local
earthquake:

* **Top traces:** original filtered data.
* **Bottom trace:** Resulting trace, e.g. L2.
* **First red line:** the time of the referenced pick. A pick pick should be selected.
* **Additional phase picks** are shown on top of the data.
* **Light blue line:** the S pick which would be made based on the selected
  parameters. The number next to 'AIC' indicates the SNR.
* **Lower section:** Parameters which can be adjusted.

The initial parameters are read from the global binding configuration from the
selected stream. Change the parameters to find the optimum
values. Click on the *Update* button to apply them in the GUI.
In order to make use of the tested parameters their values must be configured in
the bindings parameter of :program:`scautopick` or the respective alias.
