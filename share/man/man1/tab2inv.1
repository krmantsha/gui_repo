.SH NAME
tab2inv \- SeisComP Documentation
.sp
\fBtab to SeisComp3 inventory converter\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The tab2inv program is part of the nettab package distributed together with the
\fISeisComP\fP package. The nettab is a text\-based format developed inside the
GEOFON data center to describe seismological instruments responses information.
The tab2inv program can generate \fISeisComP\fP inventory files by parsing
\'\'tab files\'\' as described by in the nettab format.
.sp
This program can read a set of tab files in the nettab format,
verify their contents and generate inventory for the stations
described in them.

Allow prefixing of the instrument (Datalogger or Sensor) name attribute on the inventory generated by a prefix. This option is normally used when you want to convert many networks that share the same instrumentation in different calls of the program. In each call of the program you can supply the network code and year as padding to guarantee that the instruments generated in both runs of the program will have different name values that are used as Key on the SeisComp3 inventory.
