\fBModule for locating local earthquakes and man\-made seismicity by DBSCAN
cluster search.\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Low\-threshold monitoring
.sp
\fIscanloc\fP associates detected P and S phases from local and regional earthquakes
and other seismic events for locating. It determines initial hypocenter
solutions by cluster search based on DBSCAN dbscan\&. Additional P and S phases are associated
to existing internal solutions from cluster search or solutions incoming through the messaging
system from external modules.
.sp
Due to the clustering and subsequent phase association scanloc facilitates low\-threshold
monitoring of high\- and low\-rate seismicity with high accuracy.

.SS Travel\-time tables
.sp
The scanloc package ships with densely sampled travel\-time tables for
LOCSAT locsat based on the IASP91 Earth model to enhance locating local earthquakes.
.SS S phases
.sp
In order to deliver high\-quality picks from S phases, the \fI\%scanloc\fP package
also includes the \fIsaic\fP plugin with the enhanced S\-phase picker\&.
The S\-phase picker can be applied to detect S phases on the horizontal components
or on the vertical component in case of 1\-component sensors. In addition the scanloc
package comes with the graphical debugger for the S\-phase picker
provided by the \fIspickdbg\fP plugin.
.SS Auxiliary tools
.sp
The scanloc package also ships with auxiliary Python script for
\fI\%real\-time or non\-real\-time playbacks\fP or tuning. Read the
dedicated section for more details.

The entry point of \fIscanloc\fP is the addObject method which handles incoming
objects from the messaging system. By default it is subscribed to the messaging
group \fBPICK\fP and \fBLOCATION\fP\&. Depending on which object type (pick or origin)
is incoming different working steps are proceeded.

Adjust the \fBbuffer.*\fP parameters according to the times these objects

.SS Clustering
.sp
In case the pick cannot be associated, the cluster search is started. The
cluster search is based on the algorithm DBSCAN dbscan which
takes the required number of neighbours (\fI\%clusterSearch.minSize\fP)
and \fI\%clusterSearch.maxSearchDist\fP as configuration parameters.
.sp
The algorithm forms clusters of picks by searching for neighboring stations
that have picks. \fI\%Internal origins\fP are formed from clusters.
The number of origins from cluster search is limited by the configuration parameter
\fI\%clusterSearch.maxOrigins\fP\&.
.sp
The cluster search considers picks from stations by distance with:
.sp
.ce
distance \ele maxSearchDist
.ce 0
.sp
where maxSearchDist is given by the configurable parameter \fI\%clusterSearch.maxSearchDist\fP\&.
distance is the vector sum of the time difference \eDelta t
between the picks in units of seconds and of a potential travel time
tt between the stations in units of seconds:
.sp
.ce
distance = \esqrt{\eDelta t^2 + tt^2}
.ce 0
.sp
and
.sp
.ce
tt = \eDelta x / v
.ce 0
.sp
where \eDelta x is the spatial distance between the stations in units of km and
v is the \fI\%clusterSearch.averageVelocity\fP in units of km/s. Therefore
distance and \fI\%clusterSearch.maxSearchDist\fP take units of seconds.
.sp
As the cluster search is done over time and location, the additional configurable
velocity parameter, \fI\%clusterSearch.averageVelocity\fP, is required to transform
the input parameters of the cluster search in the same dimension (time).
The velocity should represent the average apparent horizontal P\-wave velocity of
the crust.

.SS Limiting in time
.sp
In real time picks are received in the order of their creation times. They are
considered for clustering if their pick times are within a time window
before the \fBcluster reference time\fP\&. The time window is defined by
\fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP but the \fBcluster reference time\fP is defined
either by the
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Pick time of the latest pick of the received picks when
\fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = \(aqLastPick\(aq (default),
.IP \(bu 2
Pick time of the latest received pick which defines are group of \fI\%clusterSearch.minSize\fP
picks within \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP when
\fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = \(aqMaxPickDelay\(aq. \fBThis mode is relevant
if only very few stations with significantly different data delay provide the
picks.\fP Otherwise picks may not be available for clustering at the same time
preventing to form clusters and new origins.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Thus, when setting \fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = \(aqMaxPickDelay\(aq re\-setting
the cluster reference time is delayed depending on the amount and density of incoming picks.
With this option picks which have a larger delay can be considered. Such delays
occur e.g. due to larger data delays or larger record lengths.

Picks available within a trapezoid\-like time window are considered for
clustering.
For a pick with zero delay, the cluster reference time is initially set and picks
within the \fBblue trapezoid\fP (figure below) are considered.
Normally, picks have some delay which delays defining the trapezoid. This makes accessible
other picks available with some delay, too, allowing these picks to be considered
(\fBgreen trapezoid\fP). Subsequently, the trapezoid is extended until the
cluster reference time is updated.
This may be the next pick with a larger pick time
(\fBolive trapezoid\fP, \fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = \(aqLastPick\(aq) or
the time of the pick which is preceded by at least \fI\%clusterSearch.minSize\fP
picks within \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP (\fByellow trapezoid\fP,
\fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = \(aqMinPickDelay\(aq).
Thus, picks which have a long delay do not fall within the relevant trapezoid and
cannot be considered for clustering as they are not available at the time of clustering.
.sp
The trapezoid is set with respect to the cluster reference time, CRT1 in the figure below,
considering the delay of the defining pick and the time until the next relevant
pick which updates the reference time (CRT2):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.sp
The longer the time until the update, the

clustered pick in the figure below.

In offline XML playbacks, the creation times may not be representative of
real\-time conditions. Therefore, pick times may be used for the timing instead
of creation times. Read the section \fI\%Examples and Playbacks\fP for more details
and the consequences.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If picks arrive with a larger delay than others, there is a risk that they cannot
be condsidered anymore for the cluster. When only few picks are available the events
may then be missed. To overcome the issue, you may increase \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP
or set the parameter \fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = "MaxPickDelay".
While increasing \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP may slow down the clustering
and increase the risk to cluster unrelated picks,
\fI\%clusterSearch.referenceTimeMode\fP = "MaxPickDelay" will only increase the
cluster reference time if at least \fI\%clusterSearch.minSize\fP P picks are
available in the considered time window. Run \fBscanloc\fP on the command line
with the \fB\-\-cluster\-search\-log\-file\fP to learn about the cluster reference
times and the considered picks. For more options read the section \fI\%Tuning and optimization\fP\&.
.sp
Within one cluster, the difference in the pick times between the
cluster reference time and any other pick must thus not exceed \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP\&.
Otherwise the pick is rejected from clustering. The parameter \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP
has a big impact on the performance of the cluster search. Choosing the parameter
as small as possible will speed up scanloc and will reduce the complexity of the
cluster search.
.sp
The DBSCAN algorithm can deliver multiple pick clusters. The cluster search can
be disabled using \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Maximum allowed difference between P pick and cluster reference time(latest pick time).
# The cluster search ignores all picks which exceed the value. Using "\-1" enables all picks
# regardless of the delay. Unit: seconds.

clusterSearch.maxPickDelay = 0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then, only external origins can be considered for \fI\%phase association\fP\&.
.SS Limiting in space
.sp
The cluster search can be constraint to stations within a region given by the
coordinate of a central point and the radius around that point. The region constraint
is configured through \fI\%clusterSearch.regionFilter\fP\&. Applying this parameter
will disregard picks from stations outside the region for cluster search increasing
the speed and the complexity. Nevertheless, the excluded picks are available for
\fI\%phase association\fP\&.
.sp
For running the cluster search in several regions in parallel, different instances
of scanloc taking picks from the same of different pickers can be created and started.
.SS Cluster splitting
.sp
Clusters may contain P picks from the same station. Therefore, the clusters are
split separating clusters with only one pick per stations. All new clusters are
considered new origins. By activating \fI\%clusterSearch.checkOrigins\fP, all
new clusters are checked again
and clusters not meeting the configured cluster criteria are removed from the buffer.
The check imposes an additional overhead on the cluster search but it typically
lowers the chance for fake solutions and it also lowers the load on the
\fI\%phase association\fP\&.
.SS Tuning and optimization
.sp
Use the option \fBcluster\-search\-log\-file\fP to store detailed information
on the clustering process in a file, e.g. \fIcluster.log\fP\&. The given values can be
used to optimize the cluster search parameters.

The summary value can be used as a lower proxy to set \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP\&.
.SS Locating
.sp
Clusters are located by the configured \fI\%locator\fP\&. If the
location fails, the origin is ignored unless \fI\%clusterSearch.preliminary\fP
is active. Then, preliminary values are chosen:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Origin location is the center of the detecting stations,
.IP \(bu 2
Origin time is the time of the first phase pick,
.IP \(bu 2
Status is set to \fIpreliminary\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The status will be unset if more phases can be associated and the new origin can
be located.
.SS Phase Association
.sp
When a cluster of P picks meeting \fI\%association.minPhase\fP is found
or an external origins arrives, \fBscanloc\fP associates additional picks
from P and S waves which are \fI\%buffered\fP\&.
The new set of picks are used for \fI\%relocating\fP\&.
.sp
In case the buffered pick is a P pick the algorithm
directly attempts to associate the pick solely based on the residual. It tries
to relocate
the solution after each successful association. P picks with travel\-time
residuals larger than \fI\%association.maxResidual\fP are rejected.
After the P\-picks are associated and relocated, \fIscanloc\fP tries to associate the
S picks. This association is not based
on the residual but on the P pick referenced by the S pick. The S pick is
only associated in case the reference P pick is already associated to the
origin. Also after each S pick a relocation is done. In case the relocation
fails or the event residual is larger than \fI\%maxRMS\fP,
the S pick is associated with a weight of 0. The score of the resulting
origin is compared with scores of origins belonging to the same event. In case
the score is higher than the rest of the origins, the origin is send out.
.sp
In addition to origins from the cluster search, \fIscanloc\fP can also treat external
origins that are created by other associators, e.g. \fBscautoloc\fP
scautopick\&.
In case an such origin is received \fIscanloc\fP tries to associate all picks in the
buffer to the origin. The association and the following processes are the same as
described above. See figure \fI\%Simplified work flow of scanloc.\fP for an overview.
.sp
Only picks from stations within a configured time window and a maximum epicentral
distance range are considered. The time windows are computed from the predicted
arrival times of P and S waves and the margins given by \fI\%association.maxPResidual\fP
and \fI\%association.maxPResidual\fP, respectively.
The maximum expicentral distance is configured for all stations by
\fI\%association.maxDist\fP\&. However, this parameter can be overruled per
network and station by providing a station table in a file. The file name is
configured by
\fI\%association.stationConfig\fP\&. As in scautoloc each line of the table
consists of the network code, the station code, a switch and the maximum epicentral
distance in degrees. Wildcards can be used for the network and the station code.
The switch causes the associator to consider (=1) or to ignore (=0) a network or
a station.
The last occurrence of an item in a table overrules previous ones, e.g.

For associating the picks, travel times from look\-up tables are used. The
\fI\%association.tableType\fP and the \fI\%association.table\fP can be
configured to provide specific tables which may be more appropriate for specific
regions. Currently, only travel\-time tables of \fI\%association.tableType\fP
from LOCSAT and libtau are supported. scanloc provides
densely\-sampled travel\-time tables for LOCSAT.

Travel times from other sources can be considered by a plugin exposing

Travel\-time tables used during association and location may be different.
Therefore the travel\-time residuals visible after relocating may be different

NonLinLoc nonlinloc is certainly too slow for being used in
\fBscanloc\fP but is a good option for \fBscreloc\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.sp
However, the evaluation status may be later changed at
different times by different modules, e.g. the gempa module \fBsceval\fP\&.
In order to track this history a journal entry is created and sent
when running scanloc with a connection to the messaging or added to the
XML output long with the origins.
In future versions of SeisComP such journal entries will be made accessible in
\fBscolv\fP\&.
.SS Sending of origins
.sp
Before sending a new \fI\%internal origin\fP to the messaging
or to XML output (\-\-ep) it is tested against the configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Picks are removed when their travel\-time residual > \fI\%association.maxResidual\fP

.IP \(bu 2
Origins are skipped when the score < \fI\%minScore\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
Origins are skipped when the depth > \fI\%ignoreDepth\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The remaining internal origins are evaluated based on \fI\%scoring\fP\&.
The best origin of the same \fI\%internal event\fP is the one
which has the highest score at the time of availability. When meeting the parameters
\fI\%ignoreDepth\fP, \fI\%maxRMS\fP and \fI\%minScore\fP it is sent to the
SeisComP messaging messaging or to stdout in case of XML playbacks
(\fI\-\-ep\fP).
.sp
The sending of origins may be delayed allowing to find new origins with higher score.
The delay reduces the amount of origins in the SeisComP system and the load of other modules.
It is controlled by the \fBpublication.*\fP configuration parameters.

P and S picks (pCount and pCount), of loosely associated P and S picks
(p0Count and s0Count) which are not used for locating, depth (depthFactor) and
residual (residualFactor):

\fI\%score.weights.depth\fP and \fI\%score.weights.residual\fP

.SH ASSOCIATION OF TELESEISMIC PHASES
.sp
Dense local networks used to monitor local seismicity are often able to catch
also a significant number of phases from earthquakes at teleseismic distances.
Such phases include Pdiff or PKP.
Especially PKP may contain a significant amount of energy at higher frequencies.
Therefore PKP is often detected by networks that are tuned to detect
local earthquakes.
Due to the steep incidence and the low horizontal slowness of these phases, they
are sometimes located as fake deep earthquakes below the network.
\fIscanloc\fP can be used to suppress this type of fake events.
.sp
In a 2\-pipeline setup, \fIscanloc\fP can associcate such teleseismic phases recorded
by the local network with origins that were found by the pipeline for
monitoring teleseismic earthquakes. Then \fBscevent\fP scevent
will associate
the origins from the teleseismic pipeline with the fake origins from the
pipeline for local monitoring to the same event. The assumption is that the origins
from the teleseismic pipeline win over the origins from pipeline for local monitoring
because they have more associated arrivals. In this case the origins from pipeline
for teleseismic monitoring that has most phases becomes the preferred origin for
the event. This \fI\%scanloc\fP feature requires an extended license.

Let \fIscanloc\fP not perform cluster search (\fI\%clusterSearch.maxOrigins\fP = 0)
but allow \fIscanloc\fP to only associate P picks from pipelines 2 based on origins
from \fBscautoloc\fP (connection.subscriptions = "LOCATION, L1PICK" in the global
module parameters). Configure \fIscanloc\fP to associate the picks from pipeline 2
as picks with zero weight when they are, e.g., in the PKP or Pdiff distance
range. Use one zeroWeight profiles per phase.
.sp
In order to facilitate association of teleseismic picks, the picks and the origins
must be kept in memory for sufficient time. Increase \fI\%buffer.pickKeep\fP
and \fI\%buffer.originKeep\fP accordingly, e.g. to 1800 s.
.sp
In this way zero\-weight picks will not be used for locating the event but are
part of the origin and can be considered by \fIscevent\fP\&.
