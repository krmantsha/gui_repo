\fBModule for locating local earthquakes and man\-made seismicity by DBSCAN clustersearch.\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Low\-threshold monitoring
.sp
\fIscanloc\fP associates detected P and S phases from local and regional earthquakes
and other seismic events for locating. It determines initial hypocenter
solutions by cluster search based on \fI\%DBSCAN\fP [1] . Additional P and S phases are associated
to existing internal solutions from cluster search or solutions incoming through the messaging
system from external modules.
.sp
Due to the clustering and subsequent phase association scanloc facilitates low\-threshold
monitoring of high\- and low\-rate seismicity with high accuracy.

.SS Travel\-time tables
.sp
The scanloc package ships with \fI\%densely sampled travel\-time tables\fP for
\fI\%LOCSAT\fP [11] based on the IASP91 Earth model to enhance locating local earthquakes.
.SS S phases
.sp
In order to deliver high\-quality picks from S phases, the \fI\%scanloc\fP package
also includes the \fIsaic\fP plugin with the enhanced \fI\%S\-phase picker\fP\&.
The S\-phase picker can be applied to detect S phases on the horizontal components
or on the vertical component in case of 1\-component sensors. In addition the scanloc
package comes with the \fI\%graphical debugger for the S\-phase picker\fP
provided by the \fIspickdbg\fP plugin.
.SS Auxiliary tools

dump_picks: read picks and pick amplitudes from database and dump them to a
file or to standard output
.IP \(bu 2
playback_picks: play back picks with amplitudes at normal or different speed

.SS Pick and origin buffering
.sp
The entry point of \fIscanloc\fP is the addObject method which handles incoming
objects from the messaging system. By default it is subscribed to the messaging
group \fBPICK\fP and \fBLOCATION\fP\&. Depending on which object type (pick or origin)
is incoming different working steps are proceeded.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
In case a pick arrives, \fIscanloc\fP checks if this pick can be associated to one
or more origins in the origin buffer exceeding a configurable \fI\%minScore\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
In case the pick can be associated, the scores for all new origins are
calculated and the origin with the highest score is selected. \fIscanloc\fP internally
associates origins to events and only if the score of the new origin exceeds the
score of the last sent origin, the new origin is send out.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Picks and origins are buffered for configurable times as controlled by \fI\%buffer.pickKeep\fP
and \fI\%buffer.originKeep\fP\&. Adjust the parameters according to the times
these objects are required.
.SS Clustering
.sp
In case the pick cannot be associated, the cluster search is started. The
cluster search is based on the algorithm \fI\%DBSCAN\fP [1] which takes the required number
of neighbours (\fI\%clusterSearch.minSize\fP)
and \fI\%clusterSearch.maxSearchDist\fP as configuration parameters.
.sp
The algorithm forms clusters of picks by searching for neighboring stations
that have picks. \fI\%Internal origins\fP are formed from clusters.
The number of origins from cluster search is limited by the configuration parameter
\fI\%clusterSearch.maxOrigins\fP\&.
.sp
The cluser search considers picks from stations by distance with:
.sp
.ce
distance \ele maxSearchDist
.ce 0
.sp
where maxSearchDist is given by the configurable parameter \fI\%clusterSearch.maxSearchDist\fP\&.
distance is the vector sum of the time difference \eDelta t
between the picks in units of seconds and of a potential travel time
tt between the stations in units of seconds:
.sp
.ce
distance = \esqrt{\eDelta t^2 + tt^2}
.ce 0
.sp
and
.sp
.ce
tt = \eDelta x / v
.ce 0
.sp
where \eDelta x is the spatial distance between the stations in units of km and
v is the \fI\%clusterSearch.averageVelocity\fP in units of km/s. Therefore
distance and \fI\%clusterSearch.maxSearchDist\fP take units of seconds.
.sp
As the cluster search is done over time and location, the additional configurable
velocity parameter, \fI\%clusterSearch.averageVelocity\fP, is required to transform
the input parameters of the cluster search in the same dimension (time).
The velocity should represent the average apparent horizontal P\-wave velocity of
the crust.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP

.SS Limiting in time
.sp
Within one cluster, the difference in the pick times between the
cluster reference time and any other pick must not exceed \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP\&.
Otherwise the pick is rejected from clustering. The parameter \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP
has a big impact on the performance of the cluster search. Choosing the parameter
as small as possible will speed up scanloc and will reduce the complexity of the
cluster search.
.sp
The DBSCAN algorithm can deliver multiple pick clusters. The cluster search can
be disabled using \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Maximum allowed difference between P pick and cluster reference time(latest pick time).
# The cluster search ignores all picks which exceed the value. Using "\-1" enables all picks
# regardless of the delay. Unit: seconds.

clusterSearch.maxPickDelay = 0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then, only external origins can be considered for \fI\%phase association\fP\&.
.SS Limiting in space
.sp
The cluster search can be constraint to stations within a region given by the
coordinate of a central point and the radius around that point. The region constraint
is configured through \fI\%clusterSearch.regionFilter\fP\&. Applying this parameter
will disregard picks from stations outside the region for cluster search increasing
the speed and the complexity. Nevertheless, the excluded picks are available for
\fI\%phase association\fP\&.
.sp
For running the cluster search in several regions in parallel, different instances
of scanloc taking picks from the same of different pickers can be created and started.
.SS Cluster splitting
.sp
Clusters may contain P picks from the same stations. Therefore, the clusters are split
separating clusters with only one pick per stations. All new clusters are considered new
origins. By activating \fI\%clusterSearch.checkOrigins\fP, all new clusters are checked again
and clusters not meeting the configured cluster criteria are removed from the buffer.
The check imposes an additional overhead on the cluster search but it typically
lowers the chance for fake solutions and it also lowers the load on the
\fI\%phase association\fP\&.
.SS Tuning and optimization
.sp
Use the option \fBcluster\-search\-log\-file\fP to store detailed information
on the clustering process in a file, e.g. \fIcluster.log\fP\&. The given values can be
used to optimize the cluster search parameters.

The summary value can be used as a lower proxy to set \fI\%clusterSearch.maxPickDelay\fP\&.
.SS Locating
.sp
Clusters are located by the configured \fI\%locator\fP\&. If the
location fails, the origin is ignored unless \fI\%clusterSearch.preliminary\fP
is active.
.SS Phase Association
.sp
When a cluster of P picks meeting \fI\%association.minPhase\fP is found
or an external origins arrives, \fBscanloc\fP associates additional picks
from P and S waves which are \fI\%buffered\fP\&.
The new set of picks are used for \fI\%relocating\fP\&.
.sp
In case the buffered pick is a P pick the algorithm
directly attempts to associate the pick solely based on the residual. It tries to relocate
the solution after each successful association. P picks with travel\-time
residuals larger than \fI\%association.maxResidual\fP are rejected.
After the P\-picks are associated and relocated, \fIscanloc\fP tries to associate the
S picks. This association is not based
on the residual but on the P pick referenced by the S pick. The S pick is
only associated in case the reference P pick is already associated to the
origin. Also after each S pick a relocation is done. In case the relocation
fails or the event residual is larger than \fI\%maxRMS\fP,
the S pick is associated with a weight of 0. The score of the resulting
origin is compared with scores of origins belonging to the same event. In case
the score is higher than the rest of the origins, the origin is send out.
.sp
In addition to origins from the cluster search, \fIscanloc\fP can also treat external
origins that are created by other associators, e.g. \fI\%scautoloc\fP [7]\&.
In case an such origin is received \fIscanloc\fP tries to associate all picks in the
buffer to the origin. The association and the following processes are the same as
described above. See figure \fI\%Simplified work flow of scanloc.\fP for an overview.
.sp
Only picks from stations within a configured time window and a maximum epicentral
distance range are considered. The time windows are computed from the predicted
arrival times of P and S waves and the margins given by \fI\%association.maxPResidual\fP
and \fI\%association.maxPResidual\fP, respectively.
The maximum expicentral distance is configured for all stations by
\fI\%association.maxDist\fP\&. However, this parameter can be overruled per
network and station by providing a station table in a file. The file name is configured by
\fI\%association.stationConfig\fP\&. As in scautoloc each line of the table
consists of the network code, the station code, a switch and the maximum epicentral
distance in degrees. Wildcards can be used for the network and the station code.
The switch causes the associator to consider (=1) or to ignore (=0) a network or a station.
The last occurrence of an item in a table overrules previous ones, e.g.

For associating the picks, travel times from look\-up tables are used. The
\fI\%association.tableType\fP and the \fI\%association.table\fP can be
configured to provide specific tables which may be more appropriate for specific
regions. Currently, only travel\-time tables of \fI\%association.tableType\fP from
\fI\%LOCSAT\fP [11] and libtau are supported. scanloc provides
\fI\%densely\-sampled travel\-time tables\fP for LOCSAT.
.sp
Travel times from other sources can be considered by a plugin exposing
the travel times to the travel\-time interface.
The considered table must provide the time for all considered phases.

Travel\-time tables used during association and location may be different.
Therefore the travel\-time residuals visible after relocating may be different
from the travel\-time residuals considered during association.

In order to make the alternative locator available to \fIscanloc\fP, the respective

\fBNote:\fP Computational speed can be an issue when alternative locators are used
and when many picks are to be tested during association. In this case \fIscanloc\fP
can be configured with \fI\%LocSAT\fP [11] but \fI\%screloc\fP [9] may be used
along with the preferred locator and profile to relocate the origin. The locator
\fI\%NonLinLoc\fP [13] is certainly too slow for being used in \fIscanloc\fP but is a good option for
\fBscreloc\fP\&.
.SS Sending of origins
.sp
Before sending a new \fI\%internal origin\fP to the messaging
or to XML output (\-\-ep) it is tested against the configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Picks are removed when their travel\-time residual > \fI\%association.maxResidual\fP
and origins are \fI\%relocated\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
Origins are skipped when the score < \fI\%minScore\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
Origins are skipped when the depth > \fI\%ignoreDepth\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The remaining internal origins are evaluated based on \fI\%scoring\fP\&.
The best origin of the same \fI\%internal event\fP is the one
which has the highest score at the time of availability. When meeting the parameters
\fI\%ignoreDepth\fP, \fI\%maxRMS\fP and \fI\%minScore\fP it is sent to the
\fI\%SeisComP messaging\fP or to stdout in case of XML playbacks (\-\-ep).
.sp
The sending of origins may be delayed allowing to find new origins with higher score.
The delay reduces the amount of origins in the SeisComP system and the load of other modules.
It is controlled by the \fBpublication.*\fP configuration parameters.

.SH SCORING
.sp
Each \fI\%internal origin\fP is evaluated by calculating a score\&.
The score is calculated as a weighted sum from the number of associated
P and S picks (pCount and pCount), of loosely associated P and S picks
(p0Count and s0Count) which are not used for locating, depth (depthFactor) and residual (residualFactor):
.sp
.ce
score =\e  &score.weights.p \etimes pCount + score.weights.p0 \etimes p0Count \e\e
             +\e &score.weights.s \etimes sCount + score.weights.s0 \etimes s0Count \e\e

.SH ASSOCIATION OF TELESEISMIC PHASES
.sp
Dense local networks used to monitor local seismicity are often able to catch
also a significant number of phases from earthquakes at teleseismic distances.
Such phases include Pdiff or PKP.
Especially PKP may contain a significant amount of energy at higher frequencies.
Therefore PKP is often detected by networks that are tuned to detect
local earthquakes.
Due to the steep incidence and the low horizontal slowness of these phases, they are
sometimes located as fake deep earthquakes below the network.
\fIscanloc\fP can be used to suppress this type of fake events.
.sp
In a 2\-pipeline
setup, \fIscanloc\fP can associcate such teleseismic phases recorded
by the local network with origins that were found by the pipeline for
monitoring teleseismic earthquakes. Then \fI\%scevent\fP [4] will associate
the origins from the teleseismic pipeline with the fake origins from the
pipeline for local monitoring to the same event. The assumption is that the origins
from the teleseismic pipeline win over the origins from pipeline for local monitoring
because they have more associated arrivals. In this case the origins from pipeline
for teleseismic monitoring that has most phases becomes the preferred origin for
the event. This \fI\%scanloc\fP feature requires an extended license.

Let \fIscanloc\fP not perform cluster search (\fI\%clusterSearch.maxOrigins\fP = 0)

module parameters). Configure \fIscanloc\fP to associate the picks from pipeline 2
as picks with zero weight when they are, e.g., in the PKP or Pdiff distance
range. Use one zeroWeight profiles per phase.
.sp
In order to facilitate association of teleseismic picks, the picks and the origins
must be kept in memory for sufficient time. Increase \fI\%buffer.pickKeep\fP
and \fI\%buffer.originKeep\fP accordingly, e.g. to 1800 s.
.sp
In this way zero\-weight picks will not be used for locating the event but are
part of the origin and can be considered by \fIscevent\fP\&.

solutions. Therefore, the LOCSAT tables, \fIiasp91_scanloc.*\fP, based on

.SH S-PHASE DETECTOR
.sp
The \fI\%scanloc\fP modul provides the enhanced S phase detectors,
S\-AIC and S\-AIC\-V, as well as the \fI\%debugger\fP\&.
.SS Overview
.sp
The \fIscanloc\fP package includes two S phase pickers: S\-AIC and S\-AIC\-V, enhancing the
performance of the picker with respect to the OpenSource S\-L2. Both picker
apply an AIC algorithm in order to detect S phases after a P pick was maked.
Therefore S phases are only detected after a P detection.
Using the S\-AIC, S picks are determined on the vectorial sum of the horizontal
componentes (L2 trace).
The S\-AIC\-V works like the S\-AIC but it picks S phases on the vertical component.
.sp
The performance of the pickers have been tested by comparison of automatic
with manual picks (see the \fI\%Figure showing the comparison\fP).

.B association.stationConfig
Type: \fIpath\fP
.sp
The station configuration file contains lines consisting of
network code, station code, weight (0 or 1) and maximum
association distance given in degree. The maximum association
distance is the distance in degrees from the origin up to
which this station may contribute to a new origin. This
parameter overrides the global parameter association.maxDist.
If this distance is 180 deg, this station may contribute to
new origins world\-wide. However, if the distance is only 10
degree, the range of this station is limited. This is a helpful
setting in case of mediocre stations in a region where there
are numerous good and reliable stations nearby. The station
will then not pose a risk for locations generated
outside the maximum association distance. The last item found
in the list overrules previous ones.
Network and station codes may be wildcards (*)
for convenience. E.g.:
.sp
* * 1 10
.sp
GE * 1 180
