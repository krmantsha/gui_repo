\fBComputes VS magnitudes based on envelopes calculated by scenvelope.\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Part of the VS package.
.sp
scvsmag is part of a new SeisComP implementation of the
\fI\%Virtual Seismologist\fP [1] (VS) Earthquake Early Warning algorithm (Cua, 2005; Cua and Heaton, 2007) released
under the \fI\%SED Public License for SeisComP Contributions\fP [2]\&. For a
given origin it estimates single station magnitudes and a network magnitude
based on  the envelope attenuation relationship and ground motion amplitude
ratio derived  by Cua (2005). The original VS algorithm applies the Bayesian
theorem by defining magnitude as the value that maximizes the product of a
likelihood function and a prior probability density function. In the current
version of scvsmag only the likelihood function is implemented and no prior
information is used at this stage.
.SH LOGGING
.sp
Apart from the standard log messages in \fBscvsmag.log\fP, processing log messages are
also written to \fBscvsmag\-processing\-info.log\fP every time the VS Magnitude of an event
is re\-evaluated. A typical entry is shown below.

.SS Logging envelope messages
.sp
The envelope messages received by scvsmag can optionally be written to the log\-file
\fBenvelope\-logging\-info.log\fP by setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vsmag.logenvelopes=true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The format of \fBenvelope\-logging\-info.log\fP is self\-explanatory, note however
that the timestamp of the envelope value marks the start time of the 1 s waveform
window over which the envelope value was computed. Depending on the size of your
seismic network, \fBenvelope\-logging\-info.log\fP might quickly use a lot of disk
space.
.SS Computing the likelihood value
.sp
The likelihood is computed as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
likelihood = Magnitude check * Arrivals check * Azimuthal Gap Check
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the magnitude check exceeds a magnitude dependent threshold its value is set
to 0.4, otherwise it is 1.0. The thresholds are defined as follows:
.TS

.TE
.sp
If the arrivals check exceeds a value of 0.5 (i.e. more than half of the real\-time
stations within a certain epicentral distance have not contributed picks to the
location) its value is set to 0.3, otherwise it is 1.0. The epicentral distance
threshold is the middle between the maximum and the average epicentral distance
of the stations contributing picks to the location.
.sp
The permissible azimuthal gap can be configured (default is 300). If it is
exceeded, \(aqAzimuthal Gap Check\(aq is set to 0.2, otherwise it is set to 1.0.
.sp
A likelihood of 0.024, therefore, indicates, that all three quality checks failed.
If all quality checks succeeded the likelihood is set to 0.99.
.SS scvsmag configuration
.sp
scvsmag receives the amplitudes from scenvelope via the messaging system.
When the scenvelope is configured to send the amplitudes to the "VS" group
instead of "AMPLITUDE", the configuration must be adjusted.
In this case, replace the "AMPLITUDE" group with the "VS" message group in \fBconnection.subscriptions\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
connection.subscriptions = VS, EVENT, LOCATION, PICK
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Consider also the remaining \fI\%configuration parameters\fP\&.
.SH SCAUTOLOC CONFIGURATION
.sp
Because scautoloc was not designed with EEW in mind, there are a few
settings necessary to ensure that location estimates are sent to scvsmag as
quickly as possible:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# If this string is non\-empty, an amplitude obtained from an amplitude object
# is used by ... . If this string is "mb", a period obtained from the amplitude
# object is also used; if it has some other value, then 1 is used. If
# this string is empty, then the amplitude is set to 0.5 * thresholdXXL, and 1
# is used for the period.
autoloc.amplTypeAbs = snr

# This is the parameter "a" in the equation Δt = aN + b for the time interval
# between origin updates.
autoloc.publicationIntervalTimeSlope = 0

# This is the parameter "b" in the above mentioned equation for the update
# interval Δt.
autoloc.publicationIntervalTimeIntercept = 0

# Minimum number of phases.
autoloc.minPhaseCount = 6
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For scautoloc to provide locations with 6 stations, its grid configuration file
requires to be setup with equal or lower minimum pick count, and with a corresponding
maximum station distance to avoid false alerts.
.sp
For scautopick to provide snr amplitudes quickly requires the following
setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# The time window used to compute a maximum (snr) amplitude on the filtered
# waveforms.
thresholds.amplMaxTimeWindow = 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SCEVENT CONFIGURATION
.sp
For scevent to create an event from an origin with 6 phases requires the
following setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Minimum number of Picks for an Origin that is automatic and cannot be
# associated with an Event to be allowed to form an new Event.
eventAssociation.minimumDefiningPhases = 6
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
scautoloc also has a so\-called XXL feature that allows you to create a
location estimate with 4 P\-wave detections (otherwise 6 is the minimum).
Although this feature is reserved for large magnitude events you can, in
principle, adapt the XXL thresholds to also locate moderate seismicity with the
first four picks. This may, however, lead to a larger number of false alerts
and it is, therefore, recommended to used this feature only as intended.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If scvsmag receives identical picks from different pipelines, the internal
buffering fails. The missing picks are automatically retrieved from the
database if necessary and if a connection to the database has been established.
Alternatively, if picking is done on the same streams in several pipelines, they
can be distinguished by modifying their respective public IDs.
