.SS Summary widget
.sp
The summary widget in the Location tab contains two other tabs: \fIPreferred\fP and
\fICurrent\fP\&. \fIPreferred\fP
reflects the current official (database) state of the event while \fICurrent\fP
shows the current solution (location and magnitudes). Activate the Summary widget
by pressing \fBF8\fP or from the \fIView\fP menu.

.SS Diagrams
.sp
The default arrival residual plot is shown in the figure above. Additional
plots are available to analyze arrivals which can be shown by activating the
corresponding tab.
.sp
In these diagrams, arrival can be activated or deactivating for \fI\%relocating\fP
by clicking on a point or by selecting a range using mouse drag. Deselecting is
available by mouse drag when pressing kbd:\fICtrl\fP\&.

From upper left to lower right: \fB1\fP) azimuth vs distance, \fB2\fP) travel time vs distance,
\fB3\fP) travel time \- predicted travel time vs distance, \fB4\fP) azimuth vs distance polar
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The move out plot uses the reduced travel time with a default reduction velocity
of 6km/s. This value is configurable by \fI\%olv.Pvel\fP, either in the configuration file
(\fBscolv.cfg\fP) or in the \fI\%settings window\fP, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
The diagrams in the scolv Location tab present observations (e.g. arrival residuals). Each plot
is also interactive to select a subset of data or to zoom into a region.
.sp
A plot filter can be defined. Filtering means that arrivals that match the
filter are not plotted. They are filtered out visually. To enable a filter
click the link "not active" right below the plot tabs. A setup window pops up
where the filter can be defined. Currently only a filter by azimuth around
epicenter can be applied.

Select the center azimuth and the extent to either side. If OK is pressed all
arrivals that fall outside the defined azimuthal area are hidden from the plot
and the line below the tabs turns into "Filter is active". Clicking on the
link again and select the "None" filter will show all arrivals in the plot again.
.sp
Plots can also be configured to show or hide dashed grid lines. Use \fI\%olv.drawGridLines\fP
for configuration (\fBscolv.cfg\fP). The default is true.
.SS Arrival table
.sp
The arrival table shows all arrivals of the current origin. The columns are
sortable by clicking on the corresponding header item. Additional data columns
can be shown or active columns can be hidden, either initially or interactively.

.sp
The checkbox in the first column indicates if the arrival was used for locating the
origin. The overall usage state of arrival contains three flags: arrival time used,
backazimuth used and slowness used. If any of these flags is active then the
overall usage state is active as well. The arrival table shows those flags indicated
by \fBT\fP for pick time, \fBS\fP for horizontal slowness and \fBB\fP for backazimuth.
A flag is rendered with a dash if the referred pick does not contain the
corresponding feature. For example, if a pick does not carry a backazimuth
measure then the backazimuth flag is disabled. It would not make sense to
activate backazimuth usage without a corresponding measure.
.sp
In most cases, only the time flag, indicated by the capital \fBT\fP, will be active.
The other two flags are rendered with dashes, meaning that they are inactive.
Background: an arrival refers to a pick which can hold several features. The basic
feature a pick must hold is the pick time. Some modules such as for array processing
might compute additional pick features. Such features can be the backazimuth and
the horizontal slowness. Locators like LocSAT were developed to use those features
to increase the precision of a location. Special applictions are locations based
borehole networks with poor azimuthal coverage or locations with very few stations.
.sp
There may be cases where a backazimuth measure of a pick should not be used by
the locator. In contrast, if a backazimuth is available but the timing is bad,
disabling the use of the pick time but including the backazimuth may be advantageous.
For that a simple weight value is not enough. With a weight one cannot separate
whether or not to use a particular feature. So the arrival does not only refer
to a pick but holds flags indicating which features of that pick should be used
for locating.

Magnitudes that were not computed due to missing data or low signa\-to\-noise
ratios have a cross button rendered in their tab headers and their value is
nan (not a number). Furthermore was the status of the magnitude set to
rejected. To manually review the waveforms and to fine tune the
parameters, open the waveforms and add at least one station magnitude. Otherwise
the rejected magnitude will be removed from the origin prio to committing it.
.SS Summary magnitude
.sp
The summary magnitude typically is calculated from all network magnitudes
by scmag and set as preferred magnitude type by scevent after committing
or confirming an origin. The defaults can be changed by configuring scmag
and scevent\&.
.sp
However, in combination with \fI\%custom commit buttons\fP,
the network magnitude to be considered as the preferred can be set by hitting this
configured button or interactively in the \fI\%magnitude tab\fP
of scolv. Interactively check the box in the network magnitudes tab, then press the
custom commit button. Setting the preferred magnitude interactively in the magnitude
tab takes priority over the configuration of the custom commit button.
.SS Waveform review
.sp
The magnitude review page also allows the review of waveforms.
The button \fIWaveforms\fP brings up the amplitude waveform review page.
The waveform review magnitude type is the same as the currently active tab.

The initial view loads all traces of all arrivals within the defined distance
for that magnitude type. The zoom trace shows all components required for this
particular amplitude type and the lower part shows all stations and only the
currently active component. All traces are aligned on trigger time (blue P marker).
If a station has got an amplitude it shows up as a red (automatic
determined amplitude) or green (manually determined amplitude) marker.
This display is similar to the Picker.

By default the processed waveforms are displayed. To look at the raw waveforms

.SS Processing settings
.sp
A basic amplitude processor uses two basic settings: Minimum signal/noise
ratio (SNR) and data time windows. The default minimum SNR is defined by the
implementation of the amplitude algorithm. This default SNR is shown in the
toolbar right from \fIMin SNR:\fP\&. In some situations an operator might want to
increase or decrease the minimum SNR for some reason. This can be done by
modifying the value in the corresponding spin box.
.sp
In the time scale of the zoom widget and the overview three black triangles are
visible. Those triangles can be used to adjust the data time windows of either
the zoom trace (upper part) or all traces (lower part) by dragging the handle
with the left mouse button.
.sp
Some amplitude processors allow the modification of the type of amplitude
measurement (e.g. absolute maximum or peak\-to\-peak) and/or the amplitude
combiner procedure. This procedure is mostly used when a final amplitude from
two components is computed, e.g. ML on the horizontals. The combiner procedure
defines how the amplitudes of each horizontal are combined to a single amplitude,
e.g. by taking the maximum of both or the average.
.sp
If the amplitude processor allows any of these options the corresponding drop
down boxes are enabled in the toolbar and can be used to change the defaults.

.SS Calculate amplitudes
.sp
To calculate the amplitudes of all traces with the current settings press the
green check in the toolbar. It will process all traces and recalculate the
amplitudes within the shown time windows. If an error occurs it will show up as
a small message box in the station trace itself. If a new amplitude is available
its state is set to manual and the marker is updated to reflect the new position
of the amplitude. If the mouse hovers an amplitude marker a tooltip pops up
after a certain amount of time and shows information about the amplitude.

.UNINDENT
.SS Add stations in range
.sp
Unpicked or unassociated stations can be added the same way as in the manual
picker. The new stations will not have an amplitude and need either manual
picking or global amplitude recalculation.
.SS Remove bad stations
.sp
Stations can be disabled by either double clicking on the trace label in the
overview or by deactivating an amplitude similar to deactivating a pick.
.SS Confirm the amplitudes
.sp
The red button in the toolbar confirms all amplitudes and transfers them to the
magnitude review page. Only activated amplitudes are transferred. Disabled
stations or disabled amplitudes are ignored. At this stage all magnitudes are
calculated and the network magnitude is calculated according to the available
settings: \fIMean\fP, \fIMedian\fP or \fITrimmed mean\fP\&.
