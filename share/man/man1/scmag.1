\fBCalculates magnitudes of different types.\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The purpose of scmag is to compute magnitudes from pre\-computed amplitudes.
Instead it takes amplitudes and origins as input and produces StationMagnitudes
and (network) Magnitudes as output. It does not access waveforms.
The resulting magnitudes are sent to the "MAGNITUDE" group. scmag doesn’t access
any waveforms. It only uses amplitudes previously calculated.
.sp
The purpose of scmag is the decoupling of magnitude computation from amplitude
measurements. This allows several modules to generate amplitudes concurrently,
like scautopick or scamp\&. As soon as an origin comes in, the amplitudes related
to the picks are taken either from the memory buffer or the database to compute
the magnitudes.
.SS Relationship between amplitudes and origins
.sp
scmag makes use of the fact that origins sent by scautoloc, scolv
or other modules include
the complete set of arrivals, which reference picks used for origin computation.
The picks in turn are referenced by a number of amplitudes, some of which are
relevant for magnitude computation.
.SS Primary magnitudes
.sp
Primary magnitudes are computed from amplitudes and station\-event distances.
Currently the following primary magnitude types are implemented:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ML
Local magnitude calculated on the vertical component using a correction term
to fit with the standard ML
.TP
.B MLv
Local magnitude calculated on the vertical component using a correction term
to fit with the standard ML
.TP
.B MLh
Local magnitude calculated on the horizontal components to SED specifications.
.TP
.B MLr
Local magnitude calculated from MLv amplitudes based on GNS/GEONET specifications
for New Zealand.
.TP
.B MN
Nuttli magnitude for Canada and other Cratonic regions as defined by \fI\%Nuttli\fP [1] (1973).
.TP
.B mb
Narrow band body wave magnitude measured on a WWSSN\-SP filtered trace
.TP
.B mBc
Cumulative body wave magnitude
.TP
.B mB
Broad band body wave magnitude
.TP
.B Mwp
The body wave magnitude of \fI\%Tsuboi\fP [3] et al. (1995)
.TP
.B Mjma
Mjma is computed on displacement data using body waves of period < 30s
.TP
.B Ms_20
Surface\-wave magnitude at 20 s period
.TP
.B Ms(BB)
Broad band surface\-wave magnitude
.TP
.B Md
Duration magnitude as described in the documentation of \fI\%HYPOINVERSE\fP [2]
.UNINDENT
.SS Derived magnitudes
.sp
Additionally, scmag derives the following magnitudes from primary magnitudes:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Mw(mB)
Estimation of the moment magnitude Mw based on mB using the Mw vs. mB
regression of Bormann and Saul (2008)
.TP
.B Mw(Mwp)
Estimation of the moment magnitude Mw based on Mwp using the Mw vs. Mwp
regression of Whitmore et al. (2002)
.TP
.B M
Summary magnitude, which consists of a weighted average of the individual
magnitudes and attempts to be a best possible compromise between all magnitudes.
See below for configuration and also scevent for how to add the summary magnitude
to the list of possible preferred magnitudes or how to make it always preferred.
.sp
More details are given in the \fI\%section Summary magnitude\fP\&.
.TP
.B Mw(avg)
Estimation of the moment magnitude Mw based on a weighted average of other
magnitudes, currently MLv, mb and Mw(mB), in future possibly other magnitudes as
well, especially those suitable for very large events. The purpose of Mw(avg) is
to have, at any stage during the processing, a “best possible” estimation of the
magnitude by combining all available magnitudes into a single, weighted average.
Initially the average will consist of only MLv and/or mb measurements, but as soon
as Mw(mB) measurements become available, these (and in future other large\-event
magnitudes) become progressively more weight in the average.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If an amplitude is updated, the corresponding magnitude is updated as well.
This allows the computation of preliminary, real\-time magnitudes even before
the full length of the P coda is available.
.SH STATION MAGNITUDES
.sp
Station magnitudes of a \fI\%particular magnitude type\fP are
calculated based on amplitude values
considered by this magnitude type and the distance between the event and the station
at which the amplitude was measured. Typically, epicentral distance is used.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Usually station magnitudes use amplitudes of the same type. However, some magnitude
consider amplitudes of another type. E.g. MLr
uses amplitudes computed for MLv\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH NETWORK MAGNITUDES
.sp
The network magnitude is a magnitude value summarizing several \fI\%station magnitudes\fP
values of one origin\&.
Different methods are available for summarizing the station magnitudes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
mean: the usual mean value
.IP \(bu 2
trimmed mean value:
To stabilize the network magnitudes the smallest and the largest 12.5% of the
station magnitude values are removed before computing the mean.
.IP \(bu 2
median: the usual median value
.IP \(bu 2
median trimmed mean:
Removing all station magnitudes with a distance greater than 0.5 (default)
from the median of all station magnitudes and computing the mean of all
remaining station magnitudes.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Default values apply for each magnitude type.
In scolv the methods, the stations magnitudes and other parameters can be
selected interactively.
.SH SUMMARY MAGNITUDE
.sp
scmag can compute a summary magnitude as a weighted sum from all available
\fI\%network magnitudes\fP\&.
This magnitude is typically called \fBM\fP as configured in \fI\%summaryMagnitude.type\fP\&.
.sp
It is computed as a weighted average over the available magnitudes:
.sp
.ce
M = \efrac{\esum w_{i} M_{i}}{\esum w_i}

w_{i} = a_i stationCount(M_{i}) + b_i
.ce 0
.sp
The coefficients a and b can be configured per magnitude type by \fI\%summaryMagnitude.coefficients.a\fP
and \fI\%summaryMagnitude.coefficients.b\fP, respectively.
Furthermore each magnitude type can be specifically added to or excluded from the summary magnitude calculation
as defined in \fI\%summaryMagnitude.whitelist\fP or \fI\%summaryMagnitude.blacklist\fP,
respectively.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
While the magnitudes are computed by scmag the decision about the preferred
magnitude of an event is made by scevent\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH PREFERRED MAGNITUDE
.sp
The preferred magnitude of an event is set automatically by scevent
or interactively in scolv\&. It can be any network magnitude or the summary magnitude.

This is the minimum station magnitude required for any magnitude to contribute to
the summary magnitude at all. If this is set to 4 then no magnitude with less than
4 station magnitudes is taken into consideration even if this results in no summary
magnitude at all. For this reason, the default here is 1 but in a purely automatic
system it should be higher, at least 4 is recommended.

Defines an event parameters XML file to be read and processed. This
implies offline mode and only processes all origins contained
in that file. It computes station magnitudes for all picks associated
with an origin where amplitudes are available and the corresponding
network magnitudes. Station and network magnitudes having the
evaluation status set are ignored. Use the \-\-force to include those

.B \-\-static
With that flag all existing station magnitudes are recomputed
based on their associated amplitudes. If an amplitude cannot
be accessed, no station magnitude is updated.
Network magnitudes are recomputed based on their station
magnitude contributions. No new objects will
be created in this mode, it only updates values and weights.
The method to accumulate the station magnitudes to form the network
magnitude will be read from the existing object and replicated.
If it cannot be interpreted then the configured default for this
magnitude type will be used instead. Weights of station magnitudes
will be changed according to the accumulation method of the
network magnitude.
