\fBImport/export MiniSEED data to/from SDS archives.\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The archive tool scart reads and writes SDS archives and files
in miniSEED format and checks miniSEED archives or prints stream information.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDump mode:\fP Create miniSEED files (multiplexed), e.g. for playbacks, from
SDS structured data (e.g. created by slarchive).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDump mode:\fP Play back records directly out of an SDS structure.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBImport mode:\fP Import multiplexed miniSEED files into a local SDS waveform
archive.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBImport mode:\fP Import data using the global_recordstream interface
into a local SDS waveform archive.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBImport mode:\fP Read data from any global_recordstream interface
and dump it to file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCheck mode:\fP Check an archive of miniSEED files for out\-of\-order records in
files.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
When creating SDS archives, scart simply appends the new records to
existing ones. Multiple imports of the same data result in duplication.
.IP \(bu 2
Out\-of\-order imports of waveforms into a SDS archive result in out\-of\-order
records which may not be processed. Clean your archive using scmssort\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBefore importing miniSEED data\fP into an SDS archive they must be sorted
by time and duplicate records must be removed. Otherwise, the SDS archive
may not be correctly readable by other modules. Therefore, combine scart
with scmssort for multiplexing and removal of duplicates.

scart can make use of global_recordstream implementations which are
provided by additional plugins. For loading additional plugins, e.g. the \fIxyz\fP
plugin create and configure \fBscart.cfg\fP:

\fBHINT:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The usage of wildcards in place of network, station, location or channel code
is allowed in many options (\-n, \-c, \-l, \-\-list, \-\-nslc) and follows these rules:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Import mode: the wildcards are passed to the global_recordstream interface,
that interprets them. Normally both "*" and "?" are supported by RecordStreams.
.IP \(bu 2
Dump mode: the wildcards are interpreted by scart command that supports "*" for
network, station, location codes and "*", "?", "(", ")", "|" for channel code.

Extract data from the default SDS archive in \fB$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/lib/archive\fP
or from a local SDS archive [SDS archive] into a miniSEED file \fBfile.mseed\fP
and sort by end time of the records:

scart \-dsvE \-t \(aq[start\-time]~[end\-time]\(aq [SDS archive] > [file.mseed]

It is possible to achieve the same result of the dump mode using a
combination of the input mode and the scmssort command, which allows
to read the input data from any supported global_recordstream,
not only an SDS archive:

Push miniSEED data from file \fBfile.mseed\fP into a local SDS
archive or a file. Additionally, you may check if the records of archived
files are correctly ordered, filter by time and/or with NSLC list and print
the output streams:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
scmssort \-u \-E [file.mseed] > sorted.mseed

.IP 3. 3
Collect data using the global_recordstream interface (e.g. FDSNWS server)
and write to a miniSEED file or import it into a local SDS archive. The
data streams and the time spans can be defined in several ways. The data streams
(\fB\-\-list\fP) can be automatically generated, e.g., by scevtstreams\&.

.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.sp
\fBscart [options] {archive\-dir}\fP
.sp
The last option has to be the archive directory when dump mode is enabled.
When no archive directory is explicitly given,
$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/lib/archive or the current directory
is used depending on whether $SEISCOMP_ROOT has been set or not.
The default operation mode is import. That means that a multiplexed
MiniSEED file or another record source such as ArcLink is used to import
records into a SDS structure.

rule(s). A rule is "[match\-stream:]rename\-stream" and match\-stream
is optional. match\-stream and rename\-stream are in the
"NET.STA.LOC.CHA" format. match\-stream supports special
charactes "?" "*" "|" "(" ")". rename\-stream supports the
special character "\-" that can be used in place of NET, STA,
LOC, CHA codes with the meaning of not renaming those.
"\-" can also be used as the last character in CHA code.
Multiple rules can be provided as a comma separated list
