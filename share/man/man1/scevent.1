.SH NAME
scevent \- SeisComP Documentation
.sp
\fBAssociates an Origin to an Event or forms a new Event if no match is found.
Selects the preferred origin, magnitude and focal mechanism.\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
As a consequence of a real\-time system the \fISeisComP\fP modules creates several
\fI\%origins\fP (results of localization processes) for one earthquake
or other seismic events because as time
goes by more seismic phases are available. scevent receives these origins and
associates the origins to \fI\%events\fP\&. It is also possible to import
and associate origins from other agencies.
.sp
The main tasks of scevent are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Associate origins\fP to events.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the \fI\%ID of events\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the \fI\%preferred origin\fP from all available origins.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the \fI\%preferred magnitude\fP from all available magnitudes.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the \fI\%preferred focal mechanism\fP from all available focal mechanisms.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIOptional:\fP Set the event type of automatic origins based by the plugin
\fI\%evrc\fP based on the hypocenter location of the
preferred origin. This requires the configuration of the
\fI\%evrc\fP plugin and of geographic regions by
\fI\%polygons in BNA or GeoJSON format\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH ORIGIN ASSOCIATION
.sp
scevent associates origins to events by searching for the best match of the new
(incoming) origin to other origins for existing events:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Associate origins belonging to belonging to \fBthe same seismic event\fP
to the same event object in \fISeisComP\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Associate origins belonging to \fBdifferent seismic events\fP
to different event objects in \fISeisComP\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no match can be found, a new event can be formed.
.sp
Origins can be filtered/ignored based on
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ID of agency which has created the origin:
\fI\%processing.blacklist.agencies\fP,
\fI\%processing.whitelist.agencies\fP (global parameters),
.IP \(bu 2
Hypocenter parameters: \fI\%eventAssociation.region.rect\fP,
\fI\%eventAssociation.region.minDepth\fP,
\fI\%eventAssociation.region.maxDepth\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Origin match
.sp
The new origin is matched to existing origins by comparing differences in epicenter,
origin time, and \fI\%arrivals\fP (associated picks).
The new origin is matched to an existing origin which has the highest rank in
the following three groups (1, 2, 3):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Location and Time (lowest)
.sp
The difference in horizontal location is less than
\fI\%eventAssociation.maximumDistance\fP (degrees)
and the difference in origin times is less than
\fI\%eventAssociation.maximumTimeSpan\fP\&.
.IP 2. 3
Picks
.sp
The two origins have more than \fI\%eventAssociation.minimumMatchingArrivals\fP
matching picks. Picks are matched either by ID or by time depending
on \fI\%eventAssociation.maximumMatchingArrivalTimeDiff\fP\&.
.IP 3. 3
Picks and Location and Time (highest)
.sp
This is the best match, for which both the location\-and\-time and picks
criteria above are satisfied.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If more than one origin is found in the highest ranking class, then the first
one of them is chosen.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For efficiency events in the cache are scanned first and if no matches are found,
the database is scanned for the time window \fI\%eventAssociation.eventTimeBefore\fP \-
\fI\%eventAssociation.eventTimeAfter\fP
around the incoming Origin time. The cached events are ordered by eventID and
thus in time.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS No origin match
.sp
If no event with an origin that matches the incoming origin is found, then a
new event is formed and the origin is associated to that event. The following
criteria are applied to allow the creation of the new event:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The agency for the origin is not black listed (\fI\%processing.blacklist.agencies\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The origin is automatic and it has more than \fI\%eventAssociation.minimumDefiningPhases\fP
\fI\%arrivals\fP (associated picks).

.INDENT 2.5

.UNINDENT
.SH PREFERRED ORIGIN
.sp
The preferred origin is set by ranking of all associated origins. The ranking
is controlled by \fI\%eventAssociation.priorities\fP and related configuration
parameters.
.SH PREFERRED MAGNITUDE
.sp
The preferred magnitude is set by ranking of the
\fI\%summary magnitude\fP and all \fI\%network magnitudes\fP
of the preferred origin. The ranking is mainly controlled by
\fI\%eventAssociation.magTypes\fP and \fI\%eventAssociation.minimumMagnitudes\fP
and related configuration parameters.
.SH PREFERRED FOCAL MECHANISM
.sp
The most recent manual focal mechanism or, if no manual ones are unavailable, the
most recent automatic focal mechnisms becomes preferred.
.SH ID OF EVENTS
.sp
The ID of an event or eventID uniquely identifies an event. The ID is derived from
the time of occurrence of the event within a year. As configured by \fI\%eventIDPattern\fP
it typically consists of a prefix configured by \fI\%eventIDPrefix\fP and a
string containing the year and a set of characters or numbers defining the time.
.SH JOURNALS
.sp
scevent can be commanded by journals to do a certain action. Journal entries are being
received via the messaging bus to any of the subscribed groups. A journal entry
contains an action, a subject (a publicID of an object) and optional parameters.
Journals can be interactively sent to the messaging by \fI\%scsendjournal\fP\&.
.sp
If scevent has handled an action, it will send a reply journal entry with
an action formed from the origin action name plus \fBOK\fP or \fBFailed\fP\&. The
parameters of the journal entry contain a possible reason.
.sp
The following actions are supported by scevent:
